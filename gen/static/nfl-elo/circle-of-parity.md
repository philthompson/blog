# NFL Circle of Parity

[//]: # (this file is edited by hand, using "pypy3 circleOfParityDisplay.py 1970 2025 --markdown" for the content)

This page lists the earliest "circle of parity" I've found for each season of the post AFL/NFL merger era.

A "circle of parity" is a loop created by tracing a defeated team's defeated team, through all teams, back to the original team.

I've found a circle of parity for most seasons since the first 1970 post-merger season.
