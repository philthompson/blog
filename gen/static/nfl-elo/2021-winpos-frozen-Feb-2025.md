## NFL Elo Power Rankings 2021
# This is the 2021 "Never Lose Elo For a Win" page

*The ratings and rankings on this page are calculated where the winning
team never loses Elo rating points.  If a favorite
wins by the expected margin of victory or less, they take 0.0 Elo rating
points from their opponent.  If a favorite wins by more than the expected
margin, they take some number of Elo rating points as calculated by the
regular model.  If a favorite loses, their opponent takes Elo rating
points from them as per the regular model.*

*These ratings are likely to be slightly less accurate for predicting future
game outcomes than the regular model.  Over the 2012-2023 seasons,
this model picked 2,151 of 3,259 game winners correctly (66.0%), while
the regular model picked 2,160 game winners (66.28%).*

This page shows week-by-week NFL power rankings, based on the
[Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).  The
Elo rating system is a fair way to judge to relative strength of
competitors, and is therefore an objective way to create NFL power
rankings.

The Elo rating system is most notably used for rating chess players.
It can be used to calculate the expected winning percentage in a multi-
game chess match, where players with similar ratings are expected to win
or draw about 50% of games against each other.  After a match, player ratings
are adjusted based on their actual vs. expected winning percentage.

In applying Elo ratings to football, we consider each game as a series
of drives.  If one team "wins" most of the drives within a game, they'll
likely end up with a large margin of victory.  If both teams "win" the
same number of drives, the margin of victory will likely be much more
narrow.  Therefore, team ratings can be used to calculate an expected margin
of victory for the favored team.  After a game, the two teams' Elo ratings
are adjusted based on the actual vs. expected margin of victory. See
<a href="https://philthompson.me/2024/NFL-Elo-Power-Rankings-for-2024.html#elo-model-background">
the 2024 preseason blog post</a> for more background.

This Elo rating model was tuned by backtesting against NFL games from 2012
through 2023.  Over that span it correctly picks winners in more than 66.24% of regular season
games, beating the Vegas straight-up pick rate of 66.17%, and it has a
better regular season pick rate over 8 of those 12 seasons (according to
[sportsoddshistory.com](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nfl-game-odds/)).
This model also does well compared to many "experts" on
[NFL Pickwatch](https://nflpickwatch.com/nfl).
That being said, these ratings and rankings are not intended for use in informing
sports betting decisions. This is a simple Elo model derived from a minimal data
set and it does not account for many relevant factors that may impact game outcomes.
The accuracy of this model for past seasons is not necessarily indicative of its
accuracy for the current or future seasons.


<details>
        <summary>Elo rating details:</summary>
        <ul>
                <li>An "average" rating is 1500.</li>
                <li>For every game, the better-performing team takes some number of Elo rating points from
                its opponent.</li>
                <li>Predictions and rating updates are calculated from:
                        <ul>
                                <li>margin of victory/defeat,</li>
                                <li>home field advantage,</li>
                                <li>rest/travel days between games,</li>
                                <li>whether an overtime period occurred,</li>
                                <li>offseason "parity reset" (reversion to the mean),</li>
                                <li>early season shenanigans/uncertainty,</li>
                                <li>and of course both teams' ratings.</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The losing team *can* gain Elo rating points, as long as they perform above expectations.</li>
                <li>The winning team *can* lose Elo rating points if they perform below expectations.</li>
                <li>Elo ratings do not move much from week to week.  This minimizes the overreaction from upsets.
                Like all model parameters, this has been carefully adjusted to make the model more accurate.</li>
                <li>Offseason "parity reset": team ratings move a little bit toward the average during the offseason.</li>
                <li>Each week's ratings are based on the previous week's ratings in a chain going back to the start
                of the 2010 season &mdash; although only the last ~20 games have any impact on current ratings
                with the most recent ~10 being by far the most significant.  The model looks back to
                the 2010 season solely for testing purposes: after allowing for the 2010 and 2011
                seasons to play out, the Elo rating model is tested for accuracy against all games since week 1
                of the 2012 season.</li>
                <li>While it would be fun to look at historic data,
                at this time there is no plan to include 2009 and older seasons in the ratings.</li>
                <li>If you see an unequal number of rating points exchanged after games, it's because ratings
                are actually decimal values and are only rounded for display here.</li>
        </ul>

        <summary>2024 Updates</summary>
        <ul>
                <li><b>2024-11-14</b> - Added <a href="./2024-winpos.html">separate "never lose Elo for a win" pages</a>,
                where the favorite loses 0 Elo rating points for a win by the expected margin or less.  They are slightly
                less accurate than the regular model for now (picking 0.75 fewer game winners per season).</li>
                <li><b>2024-11-12</b> - Added <a href="./2024-nomov.html">separate "no margin of victory" pages</a>,
                where the winning team always takes Elo rating points from the losing team.  They are less accurate than
                the regular model (picking 3.9 fewer game winners per season) but are popularly requested on Reddit.</li>
                <li><b>2024 offseason</b> - Offseason improvements:<ul>
                        <li>After testing millions of models, found an improved model, called "v2.2024.07", that
                        picks a net 3.5+ more game winners correctly per season (from 2012 through 2023).  This
                        new model is now being used for all season pages.  See more details in
                        <a href="https://philthompson.me/2024/NFL-Elo-Power-Rankings-for-2024.html#embracing-randomness">this blog post</a>.</li>
                        <li>Added "frozen" versions of last year's season pages, as they appeared after the
                        Super Bowl in February in 2024.  See the
                        <a href="https://philthompson.me/2023/NFL-Elo-Power-Rankings-for-2023.html#post-2023-frozen-pages">2024
                        season blog post</a> for links to those frozen pages.</li>
                        <li>Added the "Season Model Accuracy" section.</li>
                        <li>Expanded many of the items in the "Season Stats and Tidbits" section to list all 32 teams.</li>
                        <li>Found a separate, better model for the "blank slate" pages where all teams start each
                        season with a 1500 rating (like the <a href="./2024-only.html">2024-only page</a>).</li>

</details>
<details>
        <summary>2023 Updates</summary>
        <ul>
                <li><b>2023-11-28</b> - Improvements to the plumbing behind the scenes, which among
                other things now allows for each team's full schedule to be shown in the season
                summary section.</li>
                <li><b>2023-11-15</b> - A model update:<ul>
                        <li>Correctly picks 2,038 game winners (out of 3,124 total games) from 2012w1-2023w10,
                        where the previous best model picked 2,032 winners.</li>
                        <li>Applies a curve to increase the Elo scores earned from small-to-medium margins
                        of victory, effectively tilting the balance more toward winning in general and away
                        from large margins of victory.  See more details in
                        <a href="https://philthompson.me/2023/NFL-Elo-Power-Rankings-for-2023.html#update-2023-11-15">this post</a>.</li>
                        <li>Increases the "Elo score" earned for a "narrow win" (again, increasing the
                        importance of wins and decreasing the importance of margin of victory).</li>
                        <li>Widens the definition of a "narrow win" and awards a linearly-increasing Elo score
                        for those.</li>
                        <li>Slightly increases the Elo score earned from an overtime victory.</li>
                        <li>Slightly increases the value of rest days between games.</li>
                        <li>The ratings and rankings change only slightly from the previous model, following 2023w10:<ul>
                                <li>the Chiefs are now rated ~2 Elo points higher than the Bills, up from <1 point</li>
                                <li>the Lions overtake the Bengals in the rankings, moving from 8th to 7th</li>
                                <li>the Bengals drop from 7th to 8th</li>
                                <li>the Dolphins overtake the Chargers in the rankings, moving from 10th to 9th</li>
                                <li>the Chargers drop from 9th to 10th</li>
                                <li>the Eagles are now 20 Elo rating points behind the 1st place 49ers, where previously they were 25 points behind</li>
                        </ul></li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>2023-11-13</b> - Added average opponent rating info to team summaries and to
                the season "Stats and Tidbids" section.</li>
                <li><b>2023-11-07</b> - A model update:<ul>
                        <li>Correctly picks 2,024 game winners (out of 3,110 total games) from 2012w1-2023w9,
                        where the previous best model picked 2,020 winners.</li>
                        <li>Uses a larger Elo "k factor" to react more strongly to individual games.</li>
                        <li>Decreases the "big win" margin of victory, effectively increasing the importance of
                        wins and decreasing the importance of margin of victory.</li>
                        <li>Slightly increases the strength of the "offseason parity reset."</li>
                        <li>Slightly increases the value of rest days between games.</li>
                        <li>Ranks teams closer to where a human might rank them after 2023w9:<ul>
                                <li>the Bills drop from 2nd to 4th</li>
                                <li>the Ravens move from 3rd to 2nd</li>
                                <li>the Eagles move from 4th to 3rd</li>
                                <li>the Dolphins drop from 9th to 11th</li>
                                <li>the Lions move from 10th to 9th</li>
                                <li>the Jaguars move from 11th to 10th</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Also added the 2010 season, which allows using the 2012 season for backtesting the model.</li>

                coming soon.</li>
                <li><b>2023-10-23</b> - Fixed conversion of expected Elo score to margin of victory football
                points in upcoming games.  This doesn't affect the model, only the displayed point values.</li>
                <li><b>2023-10-16</b> - A more dramatic model update: team ratings change more rapidly, yet I
                was able to optimize the model to pick the same number of game winners as the previous model.
                I wrote a little more background on my
                <a target="_blank" href="https://philthompson.me/2023/NFL-Elo-Power-Rankings-for-2023.html">blog post</a>.
                Changes to the post-week 5 rankings include:
                <ul>
                        <li>the Bills drop from 1st to 2nd</li>
                        <li>the 49ers move from 2nd to 1st</li>
                        <li>the Lions move from 8th to 6th</li>
                        <li>the Dolphins move from 11th to 10th</li>
                        <li>the Jaguars move from 17th to 14th</li>
                        <li>the Jets move from 23rd to 20th</li>
                        <li>the Ravens drop from 6th to 9th</li>
                        <li>the Saints drop from 10th to 11th</li>
                        <li>the Patriots drop from 21st to 26th</li>
                </ul>
                Overall, the new model seems to rank the teams closer to where a human would.  While both this
                new model and the previous model pick 1822 winners correctly out of 2785 games since week 1
                of the 2013 season, the previous model has a median "elo score" differential of 0.1152 over
                those games, where the new model is slightly higher at 0.1177.  I'll continue to test tweaks
                to the model.</li>
                <li><b>2023-10-11</b> - Tiny model improvements, and home-vs-away fixes (these fixes don't
                alter the current power rankings).</li>
                <li><b>2023-10-10</b> - After lots of feedback on reddit, mostly saying that previous
                seasons shouldn't matter so much, I went back to the drawing board to look at the
                "offseason parity reset."  Moving to a slightly bigger offseason reset appears
                to result in rankings that look better to the eye in the early part of the season.
                Plus, it increases the accuracy of the model when backtested over all games since 2013:
                the median "Elo score" differential decreased from 0.1168 to 0.1158, and the rate of
                incorrectly-picked winners decreased from 35.0449% to 34.7935%.<br/><br/>With this
                change, the post-week-5 rankings have the Lions moving up from 11th to 8th, the Dolphins
                moving up from 13th to 11th, the Jaguars moving from 19th to 17th, and other minor moves.</li>
                <li><b>2023-10-09</b> - Improved handling of bye and offseason weeks for the "prev:" display.</li>
                <li><b>2023-10-06</b> - Added +/- "since last week" fields to the Rank and Elo Rating columns.</li>
                <li><b>2023-10-05</b> - I found some knobs I could adjust in my Elo model that both increased
                its accuracy and also made the current (2023 after week 4) rankings look better to my
                eye.  More adjustments that fulfill <i>both</i> of those requirements could be made
                in the future, if any are found.  But depending on feedback I receive I'll leave the
                Elo rating algorithm to stand pat for now.<br/><br/>These changes increased the rate at
                which winners were predicted since 2013 (up to 65% from 64%) and decreased the median
                "Elo score" (where a blowout loss is 0.0, a tie is 0.5, and a blowout win is 1.0)
                differential between estimated and actual performance from 0.17 to 0.12 (in other words,
                the model predicted game score differential more accurately).<br/><br/>As for the "eye
                test" improvements, for the rankings following 2023 week 4, the Lions moved up from
                21st to 12th, the Dolphins moved up from 17th to 13th, the Patriots moved down from 9th
                to 15th, the Packers moved down from 8th to 10th, the Jaguars moved up from 28th to 20th,
                the 49ers moved up from 3rd to 2nd, etc.
                </li>
                <li><b>2023-10-05</b> - Added two more seasons to the model: 2011 and 2012.  I realized I
                wanted to use 10 full seasons to backtest the Elo rating model, but the first and perhaps
                second seasons aren't useful for backtesting because all teams are clustered around the
                initial 1500 rating.  Now that ratings are initially computed for the 2011 and 2012
                seasons, all games from 2013 onward are used for backtesting model updates.
                </li>
