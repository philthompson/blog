shoot:description:We didn't come across many birds on this little hike but I got some pictures I'm quite proud of.  After standing still and quiet in the woods for just a minute, I saw my first Acorn Woodpecker, and managed to get a usable couple photos of it.  And on the way home we came across some California Quail, also a new lifer.  It was fun to watch them run around.
