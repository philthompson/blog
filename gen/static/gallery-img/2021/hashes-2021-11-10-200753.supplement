shoot:description:Some winter birds have been starting to return to the backyard over the last couple of weeks.  I especially like the Dark-eyed Juncos.  We had perhaps two or three of them all year, but now we have more than a half dozen that spend lots of time in the yard.  They sit still more than other birds, which is kind of a calming thing to watch.  Plus it's easier to take photos of them.  The Hermit Thrushes (I saw two at once, for the first time I think) are much harder to photograph.
