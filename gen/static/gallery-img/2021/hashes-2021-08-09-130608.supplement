shoot:description:For the second week in a row, I was able to see a flock of Cedar Waxwings hanging out above the river here.  They'd often land on the handrail of the bike path bridge I was standing on, so I was eventually able to take a few good shots of them.  I also happened to see a decently-lit Osprey who hung out in a tree for a minute.
