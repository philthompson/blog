shoot:description:On this short outing to the ponds I saw a photographed a new lifer, the Wilson's Snipe.  I'm happy with the other photos I got as well.  This is as near as I've ever been to a Great Egret with a camera, and I got some shots of one catching a fish.  I got my best shots yet of Mallards and a Wood Duck, though the water itself isn't as picturesque as I'd like and I'd like to be closer to eye-level with the birds.
