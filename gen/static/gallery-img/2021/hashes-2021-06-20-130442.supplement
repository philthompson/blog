shoot:description:I enjoyed a nice quiet morning hike on this Father's day and first day of summer.  Unusual sightings included a turkey asleep up in a tree, and a new lifer: the Northern Pygmy-Owl.  I spotted a quite small bird landing on a high tree branch, out in the sunlight.  I couldn't see what it was in the camera viewfinder, but I didn't expect it to be an owl!
