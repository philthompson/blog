shoot:description:Some of these photos were taken at the park, where I managed to get a couple passable shots of a new lifer, the Cliff Swallow, and some were taken at home, where I also saw three new lifers, a pair of Black-headed Grosbeak, a pair of Evening Grosbeak, and an immature Cooper's Hawk.
