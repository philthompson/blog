shoot:description:This is another round of backyard birding &mdash; a few days' worth.  Notably, the 44th bird of the year for my yard, a Red-tailed Hawk, made an appearance on Christmas day, which was exciting.  I had to shoot through the window but was able to get some decent shots.  Also noteworthy was an unusual amount of snowfall for our region, in the days following Christmas, which allowed me to finally take some bird photos in the snow!
