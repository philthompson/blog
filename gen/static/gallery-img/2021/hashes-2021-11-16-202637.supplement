shoot:description:I took advantage of a non-rainy morning to go birding.  The fog rolled in just as I set out, so, with the softer light due to the fog, I decided to head to a woodsy location.  I enjoyed watching a handful of very active Acorn Woodpeckers but didn't come away with any keeper shots.  I did finally get my first Red-tailed Hawk photos with my camera, though it flew away before I got the chance to dial in my camera settings.
