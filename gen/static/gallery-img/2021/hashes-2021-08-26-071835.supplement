shoot:description:These photos were all shot at home over the last few days, except for the Cooper's Hawk photos which were taken at the end of June.  They were taken just after dusk with my Nikon P950 on a tripod, and were too noisy to use.  I just recently bought DxO PureRAW, and was able to remove the noise with it.  The pictures aren't great but I was able to ID the bird as a Cooper's Hawk.
