shoot:description:I had an enjoyable trip out to the lake this morning at sunrise.  It was calm and quiet, and overcast.  I think I prefer taking photos under overcast skies, though it was a bit dark at the beginning of the outing.  Anyway.  It was a very productive outing.  I saw and photograhped a handful of lifers: Spotted Sandpiper, Least Sandpiper, Clark's Grebe, and Western Grebe.  I also got my first ever shot of a Wilson's Warbler.  I saw a flock of a couple dozen peeps of some kind in the distance, though I can't tell from the photos whether they're Least Sandpipers or Western Sandpipers.  I had some good opportunities to photograph some Great Blue Herons and ended up with a few shots I really like.  Aside from all that, there are also a few backyard shots from yesterday here.
