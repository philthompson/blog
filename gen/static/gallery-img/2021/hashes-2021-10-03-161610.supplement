shoot:description:It was a very foggy morning, but I was still able to see a good number of species down at the ponds.  I was able to sit behind some bushes for a couple minutes to get some close shots of some Pied-billed Grebes, but it was just too dark to get good shots.  The Anna's Hummingbirds that frequent our feeder have become more comfortable with the bird perch I set up on the deck, so perhaps I'll soon get the chance for some good Anna's photos.
