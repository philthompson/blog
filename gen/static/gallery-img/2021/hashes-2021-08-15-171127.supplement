shoot:description:I was lucky enough to see a couple new lifers on this trip to the ponds: a pair of Long-billed Dowitchers and a Western Wood-Pewee, though both of these lifers were a bit far away and hard to see.  The same goes for my first photo of a Belted Kingfisher.  I am really pleased with how some of these photos turned out after some processing in darktable.
