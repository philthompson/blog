shoot:description:The Chestnut-backed Chickadees stood still for a split second longer, allowing me to take  semi-decent shots.  I was still shooting through the kitchin window, so I didn't get any terribly sharp photos, but these are the best I've managed of these occasional visitors.  The White-breasted Nuthatch just happened to pose nicely on a tree right outside the window as well.
