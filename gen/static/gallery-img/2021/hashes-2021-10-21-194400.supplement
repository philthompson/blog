shoot:description:I haven't been able to get out for a proper birding shoot, but I was able to continue to get familiar with my new 1.4x teleconverter with backyard birds.  I did see my first ever Hairy Woodpecker in the yard and in this county, and I was able to photograph a Pacific Wren today, which I haven't seen in the yard since February.
