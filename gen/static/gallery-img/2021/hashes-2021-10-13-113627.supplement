shoot:description:I got the Sigma TC-1401 1.4x teleconverter recently, and it worked quite well with autofocus on the Canon R6, even on cloudy days.  Some shots were a little softer than I was expecting, but overall the TC performed well.  I was able to snap a few in-flight pelican shots just fine at full 840mm zoom, and I was surprised to see that at 1250 ISO, f/9, -1.3 EV, the camera even used the fastest possible shutter speed (1/8000s).  So it seems like the TC will work great for birds in flight even on cloudy days.   There were also a few decent Anna's Hummingbird shots taken a few days ago as well with the teleconverter, again not on particularly sunny days.
