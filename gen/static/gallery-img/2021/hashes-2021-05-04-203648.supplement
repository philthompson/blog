shoot:description:This marks the third day in a row where I was able to photograph a new visitor to our yard.  This time, it was a pair of Black-headed Grosbeaks.  They hung out for a while eating quite a lot of seed and suet, and they returned for seconds a couple hours later.  I'd like to get a few photos of one without suet smeared all over its beak but maybe that's not in the cards.
