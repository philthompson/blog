shoot:description:I made an early morning trip out to a local hilltop where I'd seen some Cedar Waxwings and some blue birds the day before.  I was able to get photos of the blue ones, which turned out to be Lazuli Buntings, a new lifer, and I also was lucky enough to see a group of Red Crossbill down at the ground drinking some sprinkler water.
