shoot:description:This was an unusually good morning of birding at our house.  I've seen American Robins all over town all year, but never in our yard until today.  I also saw a Spotted Towhee in our yard for the first time since December 1st.  Best of all, I got photos of a new lifer, the Red Crossbill.  There was a group of them at the very top of a large douglas fir.
