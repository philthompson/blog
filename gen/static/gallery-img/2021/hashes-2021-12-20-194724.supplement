shoot:description:This shoot contains photos from a few separate days of backyard birding.  Most importantly is my first ever backyard photo of a Golden-crowned Sparrow (I've only seen this otherwise common bird on one or two other occasions in the yard).  There's a pretty good shot of a Townsend's Warbler, one of my favorite yard birds, but I'll be trying this winter to capture an even better one.
