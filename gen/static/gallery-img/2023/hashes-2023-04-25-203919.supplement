shoot:description:These are some recent shots from the yard here at home.  New spring visitors for this year include a Pacific-slope Flycatcher and Orange-crowned Warbler.<br/><br/>I very briefly (for only a few seconds) saw a Pacific-slope Flycatcher in the yard last year, and managed to get a photo.  This time around, I caught a quick glimpse of a Flycatcher in the back yard, and it flew around the side of the house toward the front yard.  I went inside to see if it was in the tree outside my office window, and it was.  I was able to get a few terrible shots of it to help ID it.  Coincidentally, I had just ordered the new book "Field Guide to North American Flycatchers" by Lee and Birch, and it was delivered that day to help ID the bird.<br/><br/>I also tried to get a shot of an Orange-crowned Warbler, but I only managed to get a couple sharp-ish shots albeit at high ISOs in poor lighting.
