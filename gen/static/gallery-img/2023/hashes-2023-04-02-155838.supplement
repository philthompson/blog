shoot:description:For this shoot, I was at Elliott Bay again.  I was able to get fairly low by the water's edge to photograph a couple grebes, which were lifer Horned Grebes.  I approached very slowly but they didn't seem to mind me, and I was lucky enough to get some good close shots.<br/><br/>I got another lifer as well, Pigeon Guillemot, and my best shot yet of a Common Goldeneye.
