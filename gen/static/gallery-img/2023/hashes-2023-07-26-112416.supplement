shoot:description:I again visited the coast with a couple targets in mind.  I was there around sunrise, but the fog somewhat cooperated and allowed me to take a few photos.  I saw a couple lifers, Heermann's Gull and Rhinoceros Auklet, as well as new county birds Common Murre and Brandt's Cormorant.<br/><br/>At one point an Osprey flew overhead and I wasn't able to react quickly enough to change my focal length.  I got the bird in focus, for the most part, but its wingtips were out of frame.  I used the new Photoshop beta's "generative fill" feature to widen the frame and draw in the tips of the feathers.  They look ok but not perfect.  I'll write up a blog post on my experience with that.
