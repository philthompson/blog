shoot:description:Photos from three separate outings are shown here.  On the last outing, I was closely looking at sandpipers when a larger bird landed in a shallow pool.  I determined that it was a godwit... it did seem small to me but I didn't think too much of it.  The light wasn't coming from a good angle but I took a bunch of shots (since I'd only seen godwits a couple times before).  I was fortunate to get some in-flight shots.  Other birders later came upon the bird and found it to be a Hudsonian Godwit &mdash; pretty rare in my county and a lifer for me.  If I had known the bird was rare I would have stayed longer to watch it, but I'm glad to have had it fall right into my lap.<br/><br/>I was also happy to get my best ever shots of a Lesser Yellowlegs, which for me is an uncommon sighting.  It was nice to see the Hudsonian Godwit and Lesser Yellowlegs right next to each other for a good relative size comparison.

I tried using the Photoshop beta "generative extend" feature to extend the frame, but it didn't look very good.  Maybe I'll be able to revisit this image in the future and fix it with future machine learning software.

2023-08-03-082339-54-R6PT7778-sm.jpg:description:I think this was my first time seeing an entire quail covey.  I very slowly went by them.  As I got near, the babies hid in the brush.  All the adults abandoned the young and ran down the path ahead of me a ways before themselves running into the brush for cover.  After I passed, the adults emerged and ran back down the path.  The young ones then emerged and they resumed foraging on the gravel.  I'm not sure if it was happenstance, but it seems a bit like the adults were fine to have me "chase" them a bit, as if they were luring me away from their young.
