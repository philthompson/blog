shoot:description:During some early-morning backyard birding, while many birds in the area were singing, I heard a distinct, different call.  The Merlin app's "Sound ID" feature identified it as a Purple Finch song.  That would have been a new yard bird, so I looked around in the trees but didn't see one.  The bird didn't sing again to help confirm its presence.  But after a few minutes a brown finch visited one of our feeders.  In reviewing the photos later, it looks good to ID as a female Purple Finch.  I'm guessing then there was a male-female pair in the yard.
