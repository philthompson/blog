shoot:description:It was a cold and windy morning at Alki.  I started on the south side of the peninsula, when the sun was just coming up.  Despite the cold, wind, and mist/rain, I enjoyed seeing a couple new lifers out on the choppy water: Barrow's Goldeneye and Harlequin Duck.  Both species were at a good distance but I got some OK shots.<br/><br/>As I walked around to the north side, the light was getting stronger and the winds died down.  I once again saw some Horned Grebes (lifers the day before), but this time they were in non-breeding plumage.  One of them popped out of the water fairly close to me and I was able to get some fun shots.<br/><br/>I also got some shots of some gulls, most of which I assume were Western/Glaucous-winged hybrids.  The one likely first year bird landed quite close, so I took some portrait shots.

The crow's head was quite soft, and Topaz Sharpen AI helped.  I used one sharpening model for the head and my usual "motion: normal" model for gentle sharpening on the body.
