shoot:description:A few days ago I saw a good size group of a new lifer, American Pipit.  I'd previously made several trips to go out looking for them this fall.  I went out to a gravel farm road at the edge of town.  After I parked my car on the side of the road, I noticed some small birds in the field there.  Pipits!  I watched as a couple more smaller groups flew in and landed there to forage.  I took a few looks through my binoculars, and a took few ok photos (though the birds weren't very close to me).  I'm lucky they visited the field there where I was -- there's tons of flat open space out in that area!  I'm also really glad to finally stop looking for these birds!<br/><br/>On a separate outing, I caught a brief glimpse of a couple Virginia Rails and was able to get one mostly in-focus shot of one.  Not a great shot, but an improvement for me!

"Generative Fill" works very well for that purpose.
