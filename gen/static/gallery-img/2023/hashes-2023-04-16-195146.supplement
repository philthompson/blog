shoot:description:I got a new lifer!  I noticed a Golden-crowned Sparrow and a smaller bird foraging along a path.  I went to take a photo and immediately saw the reddish cap on the smaller sparrow.  I thought it might be an American Tree Sparrow, but I also had the Merlin app's sound ID feature running and it listed a Chipping Sparrow.  It was a very nice looking, and very small, sparrow in breeding plumage.  I didn't get to approach it before it flew away.  At least I got some decent photos of it.  Upon inspection of the photos, I could clearly see a black line through the eye: it was defintely a Chipping Sparrow.<br/><br/>I also finally had my first sighting of a female Rufous Hummingbird, when one landed in the tree just outside my window.
