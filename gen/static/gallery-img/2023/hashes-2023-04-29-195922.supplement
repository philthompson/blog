shoot:description:The day after the previous gallery, I went back to the same location to look for the Palm Warbler again.  This time another local birder was there and helped me find it!  After finding it, I was able to spend some time with it and managed to get some decent photos.  It's an attractive bird, but it wasn't easy to find among all the nearby Yellow-rumped Warblers.  I wonder how many rare and unusual birds simply go unnoticed by birders.  And what exactly do lone vagrant birds do if they migrate to the "wrong" place?  Perhaps they find a group of similar-ish birds (like the Yellow-rumped Warblers in this case) to hang out (and potentially migrate) with.  It was also interesting to me how this migratory visitor could be found for more than a week in one relatively small area.  But then again maybe that's because there weren't any other Palm Warblers in the area to follow on the next leg of the migration route.<br/><br/>On the same outing, I also saw a lifer Nashville Warbler and my first Leucistic bird: an Orange-crowned Warbler.<br/><br/>Also in this gallery are a few days' worth of backyard shots, including a lifer Cassin's Vireo which was toward the top of a large tree in the yard.
