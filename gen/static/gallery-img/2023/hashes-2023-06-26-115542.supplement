shoot:description:On a brief visit to western Oregon I photographed three new lifers: Pinyon Jay, Canyon Wren, and Say's Phoebe.  I also saw another lifer, White-throated Swift, but I didn't get a photo of one.  I really didn't get terrific photos of any of those species, and I didn't see some of the hoped-for woodpecker species or a Clark's Nutcracker.  I'll have to make another trip out there at some point!<br/><br/>The scenery at Smith Rock was incredible, and it was fun watching the Red-tailed Hawks soaring around and, at times, landing high up right in the middle of the huge vertical rock formations there.
