shoot:description:On a brief visit to western Oregon I saw three new lifers: Pinyon Jay, Canyon Wren, and Say's Phoebe.  I didn't get terrific photos of any of those species, and I didn't see some of the hoped-for woodpecker species or Clark's Nutcracker.  I'll have to make another trip out there at some point!  The scenery at Smith Rock was incredible, and it was fun watching the Red-tailed Hawks soaring around and, at times, landing high up right in the middle of the huge vertical rock formations there.
