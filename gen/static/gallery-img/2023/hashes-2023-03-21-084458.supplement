shoot:description:This gallery has several days' worth of yard photos, including some decent Golden-crowned Kinglet shots (a good photo of one of these still eludes me!), good photos of a Hermit Thrush, and a new yard bird: Fox Sparrow!<br/><br/>This Fox Sparrow sat still for a several minutes, but not in a great location for photos.  It then gave a few quick calls and disappeared.  I guess it wasn't interested in the feeders.
