shoot:description:We've had a lot of cold and wet days recently, but on the first of the month I was able to get out and photograph some birds.<br/><br/>I walked by the river a ways and saw some Common Goldeneye for the second time, again too far away for good photos.  Then I came across a perfect photo opportunity.<br/><br/>There is this open rocky area of the river bank that gently slopes toward the water.  Many very tame Mallards are always there, but this time there were some other birds there, right off shore.  I was able to crouch down, in good light with the sun pointing directly at my back, hold the camera down near the ground and get some eye-level shots of Lesser Scaup, a Spotted Sandpiper, a Pied-billed Grebe, and some gulls.<br/><br/>It was only about 38 degrees, but with the sunshine, and the calm water and ducks, it was a very pleasant way to spend a morning.  I think I crouched there for well more than a half hour.  Good photo opportunities like that don't come around very often.
