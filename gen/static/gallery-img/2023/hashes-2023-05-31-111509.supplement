shoot:description:In this gallery are images from a walk at a local wetland, and a couple backyard shots as well.<br/><br/>I saw a young Great Blue Heron and a young Great Egret at the wetlands, as well as some swallows.  I was able to get some nice shots of Tree Swallows but the light may have been too harsh for some of the photos.  There were also a number of American Bittern flying around, and I managed to capture a spectacularly grotesque shot of a flying Bittern doing its business.<br/><br/>One evening, I noticed what appeared to be juvenile Dark-eyed Juncos in a tree in our yard.  The following morning I was able to take a few photos of them to confirm &mdash; my first photos of young Dark-eyed Juncos!  We always have a dozen or so of these birds all winter long, but by summer they are scarce here and I haven't seen the young until now.
