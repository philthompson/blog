shoot:description:This gallery is photos taken from the yard here at the house, except for the Yellow-rumped Warbler shot, which was taken on a birding outing.<br/><br/>We had a brief period with accumulated snow in the yard, so I got the chance to take some photos of an Anna's Hummingbird and some Juncos in the snow.<br/><br/>For the M31 Andromeda photo, also taken in the back yard, I stacked 176 untracked exposures of 0.8s each, for a total of 2 1/3 minutes of acquision time.  This was more of a practice run for taking and processing more exposures, including calibration frames.  Andromeda is too low in the sky this time of year for shooting in light-polluted suburbia, but it was good practice.  I may make a separate blog post with more details.
