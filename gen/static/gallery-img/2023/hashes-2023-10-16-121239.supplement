shoot:description:I went looking for American Pipit at a local pond and field.  I didn't find any Pipits in the field but did see a small flock of Western Meadowlark and an American Kestrel.  As I was walking back to the car, I stumbled across a young Turkey Vulture feeding on the ground.  I'd never photographed a scene like that!  It was pretty cool to get such good views of the bird.
