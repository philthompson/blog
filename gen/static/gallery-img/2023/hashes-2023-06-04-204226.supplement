shoot:description:An Indigo Bunting was sighted in the county for the first time in several years.  It was also a potential lifer so I headed out to the location where it had been reported the day before.<br/><br/>Other birders were there as well, and they gave some helpful info: this male was singing from the top of a prominent tree, so it was easy to find!  On the first day there I didn't come away with any good photos, but I returned again the next day and spent a couple hours watching it.  On that second visit I got very lucky when it landed on a nearby perch and I was able to capture some better photos (click the "Older Gallery" link).<br/><br/>This was a really fun rare bird!  It was in an accessible location, audible and nearly visible from the parking lot, and it was singing nearly non-stop.  During my two visits I saw that lots of birders got a chance to see it.
