shoot:description:I again made a couple trips out to look for American Pipit, and again didn't find any.  Still, I got some nice photos.  At home, I saw a Great Blue Heron fly by a window.  It perched up in a large tree for a moment, and I was able to photograph it.  There isn't any water habitat at the house here, so I've only seen Herons stop twice briefly before moving on: once on a rooftop and now in a tree.
