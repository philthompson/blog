shoot:description:I wrapped up July with several birding outings.<br/><br/>I got my best-ever shots of a Bald Eagle, and Rhinoceros Auklet, at the coast.  I also got to see a parent Common Murre feeding a large fish to its youngster.  They were calling out to each other a lot, presumably because they can't see each other when on the surface, due to the waves.<br/><br/>I got a chance to go up for some higher elevation birding the following day.  I was specifically looking for Clark's Nutcracker, Hermit Warbler, Canada Jay, and other high-elevation species.  I briefly heard a pair of Clark's Nutcrackers at the top of some trees, but they soon flew away.  I very briefly saw the silhouette of one as it flew from one tree to another, but obviously I would have liked to get a photo.  Still, they made it onto my checklist and thus my life list.<br/><br/>I then waited until dusk at Salt Creek Falls.  I clearly heard a new lifer, Common Nighthawk, of which I saw at least four.  I was also looking for Black Swift, which were supposed to be nesting there behind the waterfall.  I wasn't able to positively distinguish the Swifts from the Nighthawks while standing there, but upon reviewing the photos on the computer it looks like I did in fact photograph at least one Black Swift as well.  Some birds did appear to have a different overall "gestalt" of wing shape and wing motion but unfortunately I have to rely on the photos when adding Black Swift to my life list.
