shoot:description:This gallery has photos from several recent birding outings, including some to a local wetlands where I saw new lifers: American Avocet, Whimbrel, and Red-necked Phalarope.<br/><br/>I made a quick trip out on a hot afternoon, with wildfire smoke in the air, to catch a glimpse of the Avocet.  It was surprisingly large.  I wasn't able to get close for a better photo, so I returned to the same location the following day but couldn't find it again.<br/><br/>On another outing, I was just starting my day in the parking lot, grabbing my gear from the car, when I heard an unfamiliar call.  Large dark shorebirds were flying around.  I started the sound ID feature on the Merlin app, and it quickly gave an ID of Whimbrel, a lifer!  I was able to snap a few photos of them before they flew too far away.  I wasn't expecting to see this bird.  It's always great when a lifer falls into your lap!<br/><br/>On the same Whimbrel outing I was searching specifically for Red-necked Phalarope.  I was nearing the end of my route, using binoculars to scan a pond surface looking at swallows, when I saw and instantly recognized two tiny white Phalaropes.  I was looking toward the strong sun by then, so I understandably missed the Phalaropes even though I was looking for them.  They were small!
