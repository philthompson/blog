shoot:description:I twice went out to a grassland area looking for a Grasshopper Sparrow among the Savannah Sparrows.  I didn't find one.  I saw at least one sparrow without much streaking on the breast and flanks, but it had a pronounced light-colored malar stripe and its head and bill seemed too small for Grasshopper Sparrow.  I came away with nice photos of a Savannah Sparrow though.<br/><br/>I also noticed, on my second outing, a small gull with a small black bill and a black spot behind its eye.  It looked like a new bird to me but I wasn't sure since there were also Black Terns flying around, and they can look similar when they're not mostly black.  Upon further review it turned out to be a Bonaparte's Gull, a new lifer!
