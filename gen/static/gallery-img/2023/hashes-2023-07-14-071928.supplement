shoot:description:I went out looking for a rare Summer Tanager (a day after it'd been sighted) and came up empty-handed.  I really didn't expect to see it.<br/><br/>I then went out to the wetlands with a couple targets in mind, including a couple rare sparrows, phalaropes, and Virginia Rail.  I've done a little research on spotting Virginia Rail, and this seemed like a good time of year to try to see one.  The wetland is drying up at this point in the summer so I thought they might have to venture out of the cover of the reeds to feed.  And there could be some young less-secretive rails running around.<br/><br/>On this outing I caught my first-ever glimpse of a Virginia Rail when one flew from one area of reeds to another.  I only saw it for about a second but it was entirely dark &mdash; a juvenile.  A little while later, while standing still near an isolated patch of water, I saw another couple of rails.  I had to photograph them through some grasses and reeds, using manual focusing, but I managed to get a few photos!  Finally!
