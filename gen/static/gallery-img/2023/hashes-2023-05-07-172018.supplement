shoot:description:This gallery contains photos from a few recent birding outings where I went out looking for Spring migrants, including Calliope Hummingbirds.  On the May 6th outing I found one!<br/><br/>I was walking the path looking carefully for any kind of hummingbird.  I only saw a couple male Anna's (which are easily identified) but toward the end of my walk I saw another hummer.  I couldn't tell what it was, so I followed it down the path until it perched.  It was a female Rufous Hummingbird (ID'd with tail noticeably longer than her folded wings) but then I heard yet another hummingbird and the Merlin app ID'd it as a Calliope.  I stood in place for a few minutes until I saw another hummingbird flying nearby.  When it perched I pointed my camera and saw it was a male Calliope Hummingbird!  He sat still, facing away from me, for a few minutes and I took a bunch of photos.  I was then lucky enough for him to turn around and face toward me.  Meanwhile, another Calliope was singing to my left, but I couldn't find that one.<br/><br/>I also had nice encounters with a few birds, including a House Wren who posed nicely on a perch for me.
