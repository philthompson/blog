shoot:description:Finally!  On my 4th visit to this location to find some Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, I found one.  Or rather, another birder saw one a couple days ago, left notes on where it was sighted, and then I was able to return and re-locate the bird myself.<br/><br/>I waited at the location for a few minutes before hearing, barely, a soft Gnatcatcher song or call.  A few minutes later a male started singing and flying around from perch to perch.  He was easier to spot.  I only got around three minutes where I was able to see him and take photos.  He was about the size and shape of a Bewick's Wren, but had coloring more like a White-breasted Nuthatch.  A very cool bird!  I'll have to try to find these birds again next year, a few weeks earlier in the spring, when they're out in the open singing more often.<br/><br/>I'm now 4-for-4 in my visits at this location for new lifers!
