shoot:description:I enjoyed a quiet walk at some local ponds.  There weren't any exotic birds, but I did get some nice shots of a Hermit Thrush.  Another highlight was some Double-crested Cormorants perching in unusual places.<br/><br/>At home, I was trying to photograph a Dark-eyed Junco when an irate Anna's Hummingbird flew in to reclaim a stick near the feeder.  The Junco flew off after just a few moments of hummingbird screeching.<br/><br/>I also added another bird to the yard photos list: Common Raven.  I've heard them well overhead a few times from the yard lately, but this time one spent a while squawking from the top of a tree and I was able to photograph it.
