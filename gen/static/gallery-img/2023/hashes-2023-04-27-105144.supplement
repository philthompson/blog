shoot:description:I went out looking for a Palm Warbler that had been photograhped at this location, and also for a Calliope Hummingbird.  After a couple hours of wandering around I didn't find either.  I did however get some good shots of a Red-breasted Sapsucker that was at eye level, and of a Flycatcher.<br/><br/>I had just listened to the American Birding Association Podcast <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aba.org/how-to-identify-flycatchers-with-cin-ty-lee-andrew-birch/">episode "07-14"</a> about a new book "Field Guide to North American Flycatchers: Empidonax and Pewees," and bought the book, so I took tons of photos of the flycatcher and listened for any calls it might make.  I watched it for a while, and it was silent of course, but it moved around to several different perches and I got some clean shots of it.  I was able to use the book to ID it as a Hammond's Flycatcher, a new lifer.

2023-04-23-090835-36-R6PT2760-sm.jpg:description:I experimented a lot with this photo.  While most of the bird is sharp in this exposure, the head is a bit soft.  A few exposures later, I have one where the bird hasn't moved and its head is the most in focus.  I tried "focus stacking" those two exposures using Photoshop to combine the sharp head and the sharp body in one image.  I experimented stacks with and without using DxO PureRAW, and with and without Lightroom's new machine learning denoise feature.  After all the experimentation, I decided I liked this one single exposure the best, which was processed with the normal workflow: first with DxO PureRAW's denoise and "soft" sharpening, followed by a gentle sharpen with Topaz Sharpen AI's "motion" model.
