shoot:description:After Eurasian Wigeon sightings were reported on eBird over the course of a couple days, I was able to go out on the third day to try to see it.  I went to the local ponds where the sightings were reported, and I saw a few hundred ducks.  After searching for a while with my binoculars, and taking lots of photos (in case I missed it) I did eventually find it.  There were many American Wigeons there, but this lone Eurasian Wigeon had a nice red head with golden streak down the middle of the crown of his head.  I looked at it for a couple minutes with my binoculars, and took some photos.  Another November lifer!<br/><br/>At a local park with some very tame ducks and pigeons, I was able to take some fun photos.  There isn't usually a coot hanging out with the ducks so that was cool to see.
