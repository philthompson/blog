shoot:description:On this recent birding walk I photographed a few unusual sights.  I watched a Green Heron land in a small tree, and take off flying again soon afterward.  I also saw a pair of Peregrine Falcons flying around.  They had relatively quick wing beats, and pointy wings, so I knew they were somewhat unusual.  At least one of them, which I photographed, was a juvenile.  I also took some bad photos of an immature Pied-billed Grebe actually taking flight.  I don't think I've ever seen a grebe flying before!
