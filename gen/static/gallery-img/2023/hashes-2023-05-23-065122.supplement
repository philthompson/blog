shoot:description:I had a pleasant morning walk at a local lake.  I didn't see anything terribly noteworthy.  The water was quite high but there were very few water fowl out and about; just a few far-off grebes.  I did however really enjoy photographing a Spotted Sandpiper.  I photographed one on March 1st in winter plumage, and here 12 weeks later this one was in full breeding plumage.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it, and it didn't turn out to be very spectacular, but it's still fun to see how easily Lightroom creates panoramas.
