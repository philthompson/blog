shoot:description:My wife's friend, a Seattle local, led us (and our daughter in her stroller) on a birding walk at the UW Wetlands just off Union Bay.  There was a good density of birds populating the wetlands!  It was a pleasant spring morning so maybe the birds were especially active ahead of the migration and breeding season.<br/><br/>The highlights for me were a group of Ruddy Ducks, including a near breeding plumage male which I hadn't photographed before, and an eye-level Brown Creeper with decent lighting.
