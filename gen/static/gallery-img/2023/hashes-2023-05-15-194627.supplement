shoot:description:I went out again looking for Blue-gray Gnatcathers.  This time I went to a location where they'd actually been recently seen, and have been in years past.  I didn't see any, but got to watch a Western Kingbird, a new lifer, hunt for a few minutes.  We're in the middle of a heat wave here so I couldn't stay out as long as I wanted, and I think the birds were less active than usual also.  But it was great to see a Kingbird.
