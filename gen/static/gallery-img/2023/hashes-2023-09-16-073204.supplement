shoot:description:We start with some handheld sunset shots here from the coast.<br/><br/>Next, we have some shots from an outing to the local reservoir where I was hoping to see Common Tern.  I think I did see them, but they were so far away I couldn't positively ID them.  Other than that, I had some nice encounters with some warblers and a Spotted Sandpiper.<br/><br/>Today also marks my 1000th day in a row of submitting complete eBird checklists.  I may write up my thoughts on that separately, but I just wanted to note the occasion.

I looked at photos of Orange-crowned Warbler as well, but those don't have the yellow color extending all the way to the tip of the under tail like this bird does, and the bill doesn't quite look pointy enough.  I am pretty confident this is a Yellow Warbler.
2023-09-11-093847-00-R6PT1544-sm.jpg:description:I've photographed a Spotted Sandpiper at this exact location before.  I was out of position this time, and I couldn't move or else I'd scare it off.  It was moving along the water's edge, toward me, so I crouched down and waited: there was a small gap between some bushes where it would be visible unobstructed, so I had to be ready to hit the shutter at the right instant.  It was moving pretty quickly as it scampered along.  I was able to focus and fire off only three exposures while it was between the bushes.  Luckily this exposure was in focus, and with good eye contact!
