shoot:description:Over the last week or so I've seen male Rufous Hummingbirds on several different occasions.  I was lucky enough to get some decent shots, even though it was dark and rainy.  My strategy was to use a slow shutter speed and take several hundred exposures, and hope for a few sharp ones.  I have noticed (last year, and this year as well) that these Hummingbirds (or maybe it's just one individual) seem to sit still for a while, which does help in getting photos.  Strangely, I haven't seen any female Rufous yet this year.<br/><br/>Another unusual backyard visitor was a Slate-colored Dark-eyed Junco, which I've only seen in the yard once before, during the fall migration a couple years ago.
