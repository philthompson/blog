shoot:description:I heard a new bird sound while on a bike path, so I stopped to check it out.  The sound reminded me somewhat of a Common Nighthawk, which might be why my ears perked up.  It was nearing dusk, when Nighthawks would be expected, but the Merlin app identified the sound as a Northern Rough-winged Swallow.  It was kind of dark out but I was able to see some wide-winged swallows flying around, without any forking in the tail, but I couldn't see the colors of the birds and I didn't have my camera on my person.<br/><br/>I returned a couple days later and was easily able to find them again.  There were at least 3 perched in a tree overhanging the river.  They weren't moving much, and constantly calling, which I found odd, until I saw a parent bird fly up to feed a perched one.  I had been looking at young swallows waiting for a meal to be delivered.  This was a fun lifer because I found it myself (after noticing a new-sounding bird), was able to find them again on a different day, and because some were sitting still (rare for a swallow) allowing me to photograph them.

This didn't look right to me for Grasshopper Sparrow, or even Savannah Sparrow which are much more common.  I later learned people had seen Vesper Sparrow at this location, but again I'm not sure whether this image of this bird shows enough field marks to qualify as a Vesper Sparrow.
