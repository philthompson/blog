shoot:description:I made an east coast trip to see family and the eclipse, and I also saw a few lifer common east coast birds.<br/><br/>The lifers were American Tree Sparrow, Red-breasted Merganser, and Swamp Sparrow (all of which have eluded me here in Oregon), Common Grackle (I've seen them many times, but this was my first eBird sighting and first photos), Eastern Phoebe (of which I got a quick but clear binocular view), and Great-tailed Grackle (out of an airport window in Phoenix).<br/><br/>My favorite bird photos of the trip are of the breeding plumage Great Egret, which I don't think I've photographed before.

I also used Photoshop's "Generative Expand" feature to add the necessary new sky pixels, and Topaz Sharpen to help sharpen up the edges of the merged wing pixels.

Unfortunately these photos were taken through a window, and a tree branch is in the way in some of these shots in the foreground.  Maybe future machine learning software would fix these shots.
