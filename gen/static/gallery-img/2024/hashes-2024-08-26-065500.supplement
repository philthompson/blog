shoot:description:This gallery is mostly photos from a trip to Bend, Oregon.<br/><br/>Following my first ever Hermit Warbler photos in the last gallery, I got a few more.  I saw a Red Crossbill on my walk the following morning.  I was able to go grab my camera and return to take some photos.<br/><br/>Lastly, back at home, I got photos of some lifer Black-crowned Night Herons (quite a distance away) and also my first yard photos of a Brown-headed Cowbird.
