shoot:description:Three lifers are represented here, starting off with some Common Terns at a local lake.  I wasn't sure I'd be lucky enough to see them, since the lake is so large, but I spotted them quickly after arriving and was able to get some shots I'm happy with.  I also had a really memorable encounter with a pair of Least Sandpipers right at the water's edge.  I was able to crouch and hold the camera down, and after a few minutes they got pretty close before realizing I was there.<br/><br/>Next, after several tries over the last few years I finally was convinced I saw my lifer Short-billed Dowitchers.  I knew that juveniles are pretty much the only ones that can be easily distinguished visually from Long-billed's, and I knew that juveniles are known to move through this area at this time of year.  I saw what looked through the scope like a bunch of juvenile Short-billed with their orange-outlined tertial feathers with the telltale orange central stripe down the middle.  They were pretty far away, unfortunately, and in the photos only a few of them have the clear orange central stripe on the tertials.  Though I hoped for better photos, I'm glad I finally found a small group of Short-billed's.<br/><br/>Lastly, on a quick trip to Chicago I didn't have time to properly go birding but I did end up with a binocular+smartphone shot of a Mute Swan.  It was technically another lifer but I'm pretty sure I've seen them in my before-eBird years.
