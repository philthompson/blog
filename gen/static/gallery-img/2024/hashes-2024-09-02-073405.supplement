shoot:description:After a couple attempts down at the local wetlands, I was able to photograph my lifer Red Knot.  It was a juvenile that had luckily been hanging around for a number of days.  Another birder was kind enough to point out the bird to me after I had nearly given up looking for it.  It was in the expected pond so I'm not sure how I overlooked it, but a juvenile Peregrine Falcon had been stirring up all the shorebirds so perhaps it had moved from one end of the pond to another.  I also got some shots of a couple Pectoral Sandpiper, which I hadn't seen this year after looking a few times.  Other folks had reported Short-billed Dowitchers, which would be a lifer for me, but the few Dowitchers there were not vocal and I didn't see any of the somewhat distinctive juvenile plumage Short-billed.

The "landing gear" deployed here looks menacing but, at least while I was watching, it wasn't able to actually catch anything.  I'm not sure how all the shorebirds avoid being caught!  The Peregrine was moving extremely fast at times.
