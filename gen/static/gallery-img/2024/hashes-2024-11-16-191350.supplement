shoot:description:I've taken another shot at a composite "HDR" effect moon image.  <a href="https://philthompson.me/2024/March-15th-2024-Moon.html">My last attempt from March/April of this year</a> didn't turn out as nicely as I hoped.  For this image, I took photos on two separate days: the 99% Moon ("Super Full Moon") on October 17, 2024, and the 27% waxing crescent on November 6, 2024.  More details and a larger version are available <a href="https://www.astrobin.com/b9hij7/">on my AstroBin page</a>.
