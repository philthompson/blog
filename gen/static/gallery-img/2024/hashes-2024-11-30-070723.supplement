2024-11-16-081140-44-R5PT3234-sm.jpg:description:The gray color on the head and bill size and shape rule out Western Gull for this one.  I think the bill may work for both Thayer's and American Herring, but the underside of the far wing is black where Thayer's would be much lighter.  This bird seems to be growing out its primaries, but for a Thayer's we'd still see some white-tipped long "tongues" on some of the full-length primaries.  That leaves this as an American Herring Gull.
