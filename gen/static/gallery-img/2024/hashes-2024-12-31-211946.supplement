shoot:description:In this year-end gallery I have shots from a recent trip to the coast to look for gulls, and an unexpected Snowy Owl!<br/><br/>After quite a few tries, I was able to photograph some lifer Iceland (Thayer's) Gulls and a new county bird, Short-billed Gull.  The Short-billed was a 1st-year bird that was easy to identify in the field because of how small it was!  I have a couple comparison shots that show a much larger Olympic gull standing just behind it.  The Thayer's Gulls I was able to identify from photos.  It was quite the challenge to sort through all my gull photos and try to ID them.<br/><br/>While visiting family back on the east coast for Christmas, we stopped by a local nature preserve.  I asked a photographer there (carrying a large lens!) whether she'd seen anything good and she told us where she'd seen a Snowy Owl!  She said it had been there for a few days, and we were able to find it and get some binocular views.  What a great bird to stumble across to end the year!

2024-12-19-102242-43-R5PT7008-sm.jpg:description:The black wingtip with only single mirror on p10 and light eye means this is likely a Herring or Cook Inlet.  I want to say this is a Cook Inlet, because the eye and back seem slightly too dark for Herring, and because there's no black on the bill, but the wingtips (both upper and undersides) are so dark I have to go with American Herring Gull for this one.  It could be a Cook Inlet that shows a lot of Herring features.
2024-12-19-104841-53-R5PT7291-sm.jpg:description:I'm going with Olympic over Cook Inlet and Herring because the wingtip is quite plain black (lacking long gray tongues on the outer p8-p6 primaries) and because the eye and back are quite dark.
2024-12-19-105210-45-R5PT7345-sm.jpg:description:Many of the Glaucous-winged Gulls in the recent Gull Guide book by Ayyash feature slightly darker wingtips like this one does.
2024-12-19-112748-24-R5PT7456-sm.jpg:description:I am going with Thayer's for these gulls because of the light eyes, straight/thin bills, long gray tongues on outer primaries, light gray underside to wingtip, fairly light gray back, and their squat/short-legged appearance.
2024-12-19-112812-43-R5PT7477-sm.jpg:description:I believe this is a 1st-year Thayer's because of its uniform light/medium brown color, small dark bill, and relatively large eye on small face.
2024-12-19-112821-95-R5PT7479-sm.jpg:description:The gull by itself up on the point of the rock looks to be another Thayer's, but I'm less sure of this one.
2024-12-19-113808-13-R5PT7507-sm.jpg:description:The large 1st-year gull standing just behind the foreground Short-billed is probably an Olympic Gull. The primaries don't look dark enough for Western or Herring, and it's too light overall for Glaucous-winged.
