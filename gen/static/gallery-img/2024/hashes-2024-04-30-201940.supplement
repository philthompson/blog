Hopefully you can scroll by if you're squeamish.<br/><br/>On a rainy morning here in the middle of migration season I went down to the river to try to find an owl nesting in a tree cavity.  I didn't have any luck with the owl, but I'm planning to return to try again.  What I did see was a dark and mysterious flycatcher with a heavy bill and very obvious white tufts sticking out from each wing.  I should have been able to ID it from the white tufts alone, but for some reason that detail didn't immediately click for me.  I only saw the back of the bird &mdash; had I seen its belly I would have ID'd it right away (foreshadowing the next day's bird).  I also took lots of photos of a Cassin's Vireo eating a rather large winged insect.  It carried its meal down into a low shrub right at eye level.  This was a much longer and better look at a Cassin's Vireo than I'd ever had before, so that was great.<br/><br/>I saw a couple of large coypu/marmot creatures in some waterways... the first one didn't appear to have any eyes when I was looking through the tiny viewfinder in the camera.  After loading the images onto my computer, I was amazed and a bit horrified to see that it appears to be the survivor of some horrible attack or injury.  It appears to be missing much of its face, the poor thing!  I watched it swim around and even clean its face and hands normally, so perhaps it's getting by just fine after its ordeal.<br/><br/>The next day, I went again to the downtown park popular with migrating birds.  I heard a familiar flycatcher call in the distance: "quick, three beers!"  I turned on the Merlin app and it confirmed that it was hearing an Olive-sided Flycatcher.  Having never photographed one before, or so I thought, I hurried off to find it.  I eventually did find it, but it was a bit high in some trees.  Still, I'm happy with the photos I was able to get &mdash; a new photo lifer!  I watched it for a while as it repeatedly perched and sallied off after insects.  I was able to time one takeoff for my favorite photo of the morning.<br/><br/>I quickly realized that of course these weren't actually my first photos of an Olive-sided Flycatcher!  My first were of the strange dark flycatcher with white tufts shot just the day before!
