shoot:description:We had a male Anna's Hummingbird perching on the little chain suspending the hummingbird feeder, so I went out to get a shot of that.<br/><br/>Down at the wetlands, I saw a large group of Great Egrets hanging out with some Turkey Vultures.  One of the egrets was sitting down, which I hadn't seen before.  Perhaps it is sick or injured?  I'm not sure.  There was a White-faced Ibis there the day before, so I was looking out for that.  I was lucky to eventually spot it flying &mdash; it might have caught my eye because it was a good size and wasn't flying like a heron/bittern.  I also photographed a couple of coyotes, again at a good distance.
