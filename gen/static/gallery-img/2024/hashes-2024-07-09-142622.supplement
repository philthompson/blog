shoot:description:We've had multiple days in a row here above 100 degrees, so I haven't gone out birding as much as I would have liked.  I did make it down to the wetlands twice however.<br/><br/>On my first trip, I took a bunch of photos of some Black Terns while I had a good lighting angle without overly harsh light.  Some of those shots worked out ok, but I'll keep trying for a nice, sharp, well-lit Black Tern photo.<br/><br/>Wilson's Phalarope was my target on my next visit... (no luck).  Upon arriving quite early in the morning I was able to photograph a male California Quail out of the car window.  I'd seen him perched up high on a few recent visits, but this time he stool still in the golden-hour light and didn't flinch until I had to open the car door to get out.  Soon afterwards I saw a bunch of small sparrows on the gravel path, and stopped to photograph one that looked quite plain.  It appears to have been a lifer Brewer's Sparrow!  Pretty cool, and I'm glad I noticed it looked a bit different, but I wish I got a better look at it.  I also got some photographs of an American Bittern standing right out in the open, which they almost never do.<br/><br/>These were some nice outings &mdash;  sometimes going out early works!
