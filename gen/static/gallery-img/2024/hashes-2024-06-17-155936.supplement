shoot:description:I went out to try to find the Indigo Bunting that has been reported a few times lately.  I previously went out a few weeks ago but couldn't find it.  This time however I heard it singing in the expected area and I was able to scan around and find it with my binoculars.  It was pretty far away but identifiable.  I watched it for a few minutes and got some souvenir photos.<br/><br/>Later on during the walk I was so distracted trying to photograph a couple Yellow-breasted Chats that I completely missed a much more rare nearby Ash-throated Flycatcher that my Merlin app recorded.  Oh well, I guess I can't pay attention to everything all at once.<br/><br/>This was a great short birding outing and I got a whole rainbow of birds besides the Indigo Bunting and Yellow-breasted Chat: Western Kingbird, Lazuli Bunting, Bullock's Oriole, Steller's Jay, Western Tanager, and others.
