shoot:description:I returned to the local wetlands, hoping to see a Wilson's Phalarope.  I had a few other targets in mind as well.  I didn't see any of those... but I did see something I didn't expect.  A large flock of Wood Ducks!  Conservatively, there were a couple hundred.  I first saw a large flock of ducks fly, at a good distance, from one pond to another.  I snapped a few photos to hopefully get some IDs later.  I then noticed a large flock of about 100 Wood Ducks sitting in another nearby pond.  I'd never seen so many!  After taking some photos I turned around &mdash; I didn't want to walk too close and scare them all away.<br/><br/>When reviewing photos later, I was surprised to see the flock of a couple hundred or more flying ducks was at least half Wood Ducks!  Pretty cool to have seen such a large group on a migration stopover.
