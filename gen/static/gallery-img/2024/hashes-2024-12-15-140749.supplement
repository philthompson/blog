shoot:description:Gull season continues, and I found a small group to photograph that contained a few interesting individuals.  One of them appears to be similar to an American Herring Gull, but with light gray undersides on its wingtips (more details below).  I am tentatively calling this a Cook Inlet gull, which from the new Ayyash Gull Guide book appears to be somewhat under-reported locally, though I am seeing reports of others in the area (perhaps due to this new book that came out!).

2024-12-10-093940-93-R5PT6704-sm.jpg:description:This shot really shows the light gray undersides on the primaries.  Aside from that major factor, the bill is not bulbous enough for Olympic Gull, the bill is too long for Thayer's Gull, the eye might appear slightly darker than expected for Herring, the back appears to be fairly dark but underside of wingtips is too light for Vega Gull (which would be too rare to be likely anyway), and from my photos I cannot tell orbital color but I can't rule out orange (Ameriacan Herring genes), pink (Glaucous-winged genes), or red (Vega).  I am guessing this is a Cook Inlet (American Herring x Glaucous-winged hybrid) with lots of Herring influence, but it could also be a "white-winged" type Herring which Ayyash shows in his book.
