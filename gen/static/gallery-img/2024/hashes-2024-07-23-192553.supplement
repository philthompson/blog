shoot:description:A new yard bird starts off this gallery: Common Yellowthroat.  This one was making a familiar low buzzing noise, so I went and grabbed my camera.  It appeared to be a young one, who perhaps somehow ended up in the wrong place!  I've seen plenty of these birds around here but never in a residential area.  This one stayed hidden pretty well in our garden, and was only briefly visible when it moved out from under one plant to another.  After waiting for a few minutes it finally made a brief appearance before flying away.  It did return to the yard a short while later.  A pretty cool yard bird!<br/><br/>Next, over a two day span I was fortunate to be able to bird both up in the mountains and then down at the coast.<br/><br/>On a nice quiet walk up at elevation I got two lifers: Sooty Grouse and American Three-toed Woodpecker.  There wasn't a whole lot of obvious bird activity, but I walked really slowly and took plenty of time to listen.  The first interesting birds I saw were some Sapsuckers.  They appear to be some sort of hybrid Red-breasted/Red-naped Sapsuckers, which I think are somewhat common in this part of Oregon.  45 minutes later, I had stopped to listen to something else when I thought I heard a low grunt nearby.  After a few more minutes I then a heard a very loud, low sound like a large heavy log hitting the ground.  I thought it was either a Sooty Grouse or a bear!?  I stayed silent for a while and kept my eye on the vegetation on the side of the path.  I eventually spotted a Sooty Grouse!  It was surprisingly large, and I had to zoom out a bit with my lens to fit it all in the frame.  After a while it cautiously crept up toward the path, and suddenly flew away.  I was luckily able to get a few photos.<br/><br/>Farther down the trail, I had again stopped to listen and heard very faint woodpecker drumming noises.  I found the tree where the sound seemed to be coming from, but couldn't see it.  As I waited there for a few minutes, I saw pieces of bark falling &mdash; but still couldn't see it.  I walked up and down the path a little to try to peer around to different sides of the tree, but had no luck.  Finally, a little dark woodpecker climbed up into view.  The light wasn't great, so even with my binoculars and scope I couldn't tell exactly what I was looking at.  The photos show clear white barring on the back and a yellow cap: American Three-toed Woodpecker!<br/><br/>Due to favorable weather conditions, I drove to the coast on the next day.  The tops of some huge towering sea stacks held a few hundred Murres, Gulls, and Cormorants.  Down below, there were some birds down closer to eye level too.  I walked along the beach right up to the rocks.  There were plenty of other people around (there always are) so I wasn't intruding upon the birds.  The longer I stood there, with the waves running up to reach my boots, the more birds I saw.  Some Pigeon Guillemot were resting on the rocks, and I took the opportunity to get my best-ever shots of them.  A Black Oystercatcher was breifly visible.  I noticed a smaller bird blending right into the rocks in front of me: Black Turnstone.  After enjoying the atmosphere for a while, I was about to turn around and leave when I saw another pair of brownish wings flutter against the rocks.  I thought it was probably another Black Turnstone but when I looked with my bincoulars it appeared to be a lifer Wandering Tattler!  It was a bit far away, and hard to see, but I recognized its shape.  The photos I got aren't great (better than I expected) but plenty good to confirm my sighting.<br/><br/>I then drove to a nearby spot on the coast and saw my first-ever stationary Whimbrels.  All the other ones I've seen had been flying by, so it was a treat to watch them for a while.  I also watched some Scoters diving among the waves, and I got some pictures of the scene I'm pretty happy with.  I noticed what appeared to be two females on the rocks, so I snapped some shots of them.  They turned out to be female Harlequin Ducks, a new county bird!  Pretty cool to finally get them in the county.
