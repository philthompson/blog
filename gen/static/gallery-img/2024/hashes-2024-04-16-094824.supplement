shoot:description:I watched a Pacific Wren building a nest among the upturned roots of a fallen tree.  This is apparently a common practice for some populations of PNW Pacific Wrens.  It was a quiet walk in the woods otherwise, with another highlight being a pair of Sharp-shinned Hawks.

It was unclear whether the nesting material being gathered here was for building or lining, so it's unclear whether I was watching a male or female.
