shoot:description:I've got an initial version of my April 8th total solar eclipse images here.  I wrote some python code to align and stack a few exposures of the totality, to reduce noise.  I'll make a separate blog post with full-size eclipse images and more processing details.<br/><br/>More recently, I was finally able to photograph a target owl!  It was a Western Screech-Owl.  My fourth visit to this location finally paid off: I went just before sunset, in the rain, and set up my camera on a tripod there.  I experimented with shutter speeds and found that 1/2 second exposures around ISO 2000 worked fine.  I also found that using a remote trigger (intervalometer) and turning off image stabilization on the lens were necessary for sharp images at 1/2 second.  I was ready and took a few shots at intervals when it finally took a peek out of the nest hole right around sunset.  I was really surprised at how still the owl was sitting &mdash; the photos were pretty sharp with 1/2 second exposures.<br/><br/>After taking a look around for a few minutes, the owl disappeared back down into its hole.  Since it didn't fly off to hunt, and it was starting to get really dark, I called it a night at that point.
