shoot:description:We have a park visited by a good variety of birds in the center of town.  On a recent visit there I saw a few warbler species, but my target MacGillivray's and Hermit Warblers eluded me.<br/><br/>Next, I took advantage of terrific weather to go birding at the coast.  I tried using an inexpensive spotting scope mostly to see what it's like to use while also carrying and using a camera.  It definitely provides better views than the binoculars and 840mm lens on the camera, but it's hard to juggle all that equipment.  Overall though I think the spotting scope is worth carrying in the right scenario (such as at the coast).  There were lots of great birds around and as a bonus I got to add Red-breasted Merganser and Red-throated Loon to my county list.<br/><br/>Lastly, I was able to run and grab my camera to photograph an American Crow in the backyard eating what appeared to have been a Golden-crowned Sparrow.  I've heard of corvids eating smaller birds but I've never actually seen this myself.  I saw the Crow fly into the yard carring the bird in its bill, so I'm not sure whether it killed the sparrow itself or scavanged it, but I think it likely did kill it.  I would imagine it's a bit late in the year for crows to be laying eggs, but perhaps the crow was in urgent need of calories for egg laying, or for tending to its nest or nestlings.  Or maybe it was just an opportunistic meal.
