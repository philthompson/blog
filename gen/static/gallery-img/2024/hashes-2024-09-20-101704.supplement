shoot:description:Thousands of Vaux's Swifts gather to roost in a local chimney every evening at dusk.  I'm not sure whether this happens all summer or just in the fall.  I don't know how I hadn't gone out to watch this before, but it was fun!  It began a bit ominously because a Cooper's Hawk was already in position on the chimney when we arrived.  After more than a half hour of a growing number of swifts circling overhead, it finally caught one and flew off.  Once this daily sacrifice was complete, the mood lifted.  A few minutes later the swifts began to swirl and pour into the chimney.<br/><br/>Counting the swifts was a challenge.  I took a wide-angle photo with my iPhone of a particularly dense cloud of the birds, and I figure I got around half of the birds into the one photo.  Using a bit of python code with the <a target="_blank" href="https://opencv.org/">opencv library</a>, I was able to count 4,900 birds in the photo.  I'm intending to make a brief blog post about this since it may be useful for others.<br/><br/>I was also able to get out a few times and photograph some fall warblers.  My strange streak of seeing Hermit Warblers continues!  Maybe there are just more of them around this year.

I was debating between Wilson's and Yellow, but for a Wilson's, the head seems too elongated, the bill isn't exactly right, the eye ring too pronounced, the tail too short, and not enough of a green wash to the back.

2024-09-19-095154-03-R5PT2887-sm.jpg:description:I am far from an expert at gull ID, but I think I can ID this one.  For a young gull, based on the overall pale color, bill color, eye color, patterning on body, and leg color, I'm pretty sure this is a Ring-billed.  The bill looks a little heavy but not enough to disqualify it as a Ring-billed.  Plus, the only gulls I've ID'd in the area the last few weeks have all been Ring-billed.

I needed more control than Lightroom's new generative erase feature provides because it replaced a bit of the top of the bird's head.
