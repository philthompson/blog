shoot:description:I had an unusual nice close encounter with a Golden-crowned Kinglet, and I got decent photos.  I did a bit of gull ID practice, and was motivated to buy the new book <a target="_blank" href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691195896/the-gull-guide">The Gull Guide: North America by Amar Ayyash</a>.  Hopefully it'll help with future gull ID'ing!

2024-10-29-Hercules-Siril-sm.jpg:description:This is a photo of the constellation Hercules, shot from my back yard.  I was trying my new Move Shoot Move Nomad star tracker, and the results were pretty good.  I was able to do 15- or 20-second exposures without any visible star trails, but I stacked 51 13-second images (11 minutes of data) for this shot.  There were thin clouds but aside from the glow around the bright stars it was mostly eliminated by stacking.

As far as I know this indicates it's likely a Glaucous/Western hybrid which are super common in the PNW.  The wing tips aren't dark enough for a Western Gull, and the head has way too much gray streaking for a Western Gull.
