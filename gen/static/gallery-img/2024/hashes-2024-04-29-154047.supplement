shoot:description:After several days of reports of a Dusky Flycatcher down at a local park, I went there myself to try to find it.  After 45 minutes without luck, the Merlin app on my phone finally alerted me to a possible Dusky Flycatcher.  I had just heard and photographed a Hammond's Flycatcher a bit downhill from where I was, but this possible Dusky was uphill from me.  After making my way there I was able to locate the Dusky Flycatcher!  I got very lucky with my first few shots of it.  I stood there for a while and watched it move around to a few different perches, and I even returned a few hours later to see it again, but it didn't return to a close perch again.<br/><br/>While similar to a Hammond's Flycatcher, after reviewing the photos it has enough small differences to be confidently identified.  My "North American Flycatchers" book, by Lee and Birch from last year, is a great reference.  The sounds I recorded using the Merlin app were clearly distinct as well.<br/><br/>This was a fun lifer to add to the list!  I was lucky enough to find it on my first attempt, which doesn't happen often.
