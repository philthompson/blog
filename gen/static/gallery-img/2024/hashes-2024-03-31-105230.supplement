shoot:description:March 15th was a clear night here, and the moon happened to be a half moon.  I've long wanted to try shooting an "HDR" style photo of the moon with both the illuminated and dark halves visible, so I put the camera on a tripod and gave it a shot.  I'll make a separate post with the full-size moon image.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I went on a few bird walks this past month but only took these few keeper photos.
