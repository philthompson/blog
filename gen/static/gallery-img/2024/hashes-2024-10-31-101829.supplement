shoot:description:Several recent birding outings are represented here in this gallery, with nothing too noteworthy.<br/><br/>I got a cool sequence of shots of a Bald Eagle landing on perch, but it was a bit above my head, the light was harsh, and the background is plain blue sky.  They are good photos but they're missing a few elements that would make them "great" in my opinion.  But it's always nice to see these impressive birds!<br/><br/>On a separate outing, the last photos in the gallery here, I had a bit of an oddity.  I noticed a Northern Shrike sitting in a tree with a Northern Flicker.  I took some photos of them both but didn't notice until later that the Northern Flicker has a black malar stripe and no red on the nape.  It appears to be some sort of (Yellow-shafted x Red-shafted) hybrid.
