shoot:description:I made a few trips out to see some locally rare sparrows, and on my second try I was able to see and photograph a lifer Harris's Sparrow!  It was in the expected area, but only made an appearance briefly for me once.  On my first attempt there were several birders in the area for a couple hours and none of us found it.  That did make it more rewarding to return a day later and finally find it.
