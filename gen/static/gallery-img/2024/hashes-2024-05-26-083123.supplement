shoot:description:I shot the nearly 1st quarter Moon on May 13th.  I'll make a separate blog post with more details, but my goal was to try lucky imaging with some python code I wrote for aligning and stacking frames.  I stacked the best 1%, 2%, and 5% of 1,190 frames and the 5% stack (59 frames) looked the best to me.  For a "drizzle algorithm" effect I upscaled each image by 3x before alignment &mdash; with the goal of revealing more detail captured between individual pixels of each frame.  The processing times were very slow but I'm pretty happy with the results.
