shoot:description:To close out July, I added two new lifers to my list: Black-bellied Plover and Red-eyed Vireo.<br/><br/>I've made many trips out the wetlands when Black-bellied Plover were somewhat likely, and on this trip I finally saw a couple of them.  They are really cool, really large, plovers.  It was a treat to see them.  I'd like to get a photo from a closer distance... perhaps I'll have to go to Alaska in the spring.  The Avocet was an unexpected visitor on the same outing &mdash; such a cool bird.<br/><br/>The Plover was also my 200th county bird for the calendar year!  It was a real effort to reach 200 birds in total over my first few years birding here, and now I've reached that mark in a bit less than seven full months.  Pretty cool.<br/><br/>The next highlight in this gallery is the Red-eyed Vireo, which is a rare bird here.  Quite a few people have seen it in recent days, and luckily he was in the expected location when I finally decided to make a trip there today.  He was very high in the trees, but I was lucky to snap a few photos when I got the chance.<br/><br/>

It's not a great photo but it does show the square tail feather corners, which is a useful field mark for distinguishing from Cooper's Hawk which has more a rounded tail.

I was surprised to check the photos on the computer and see it was carrying a fish!  I don't think I've photographed a Common Murre flying carring food... perhaps it was heading to its nesting site.

I didn't have time to adjust my ISO and this little one ran into hiding before I could get a decent shot.
