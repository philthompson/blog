shoot:description:This is likely my only (huge) February 2024 gallery.  Most of the noteworthy shots here are from a trip to the Oregon coast: a new Short-billed Gull lifer, some nice sparrow shots, sea lions, and the sunset.

I used Photoshop to extend the image with another shot.  It didn't turn out that great, but at a small size like the thumbnail here it looks ok.
