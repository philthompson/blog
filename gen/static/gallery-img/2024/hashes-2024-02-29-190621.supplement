shoot:description:I went out in search of a female Barrow's Goldeneye, to add that species to my county list. I think I found it. A few days later I made another trip out to look for a Horned Grebe, but wasn't able to find one. I did see another possible Barrow's Goldeneye, but I can't ID it either way.<br/><br/>Edit: a few folks on the Internet did confirm the flying male Goldeneye was indeed a Barrow's Goldeneye!

I had hoped the black bar across the white area on the wing was a distinguishing feature (to tell it apart from a Common Goldeneye), and it appears to be!  Very cool.  Barrow's Goldeneyes are less common at this location so I didn't expect to see one, and I didn't even consider taking more photos.  I guess I need to get better at checking the potential species list for a location <i>before</i> I actually go there!
