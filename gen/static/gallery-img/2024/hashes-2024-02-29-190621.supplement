shoot:description:I went out in search of a female Barrow's Goldeneye, to add that species to my county list.  I think I found it.  A few days later I made another trip out to look for a Horned Grebe, but wasn't able to find one.  I did see another possible Barrow's Goldeneye, but I can't ID it either way.

Barrow's Goldeneye's are uncommon at this location so it would have been great to photograph one.  But I didn't expect to see a Barrow's so I didn't even consider taking more photos.  Oh well.
