shoot:description:I had a great two-day span where I added four birds to my county list including three lifers.<br/><br/>Down at the wetlands, I saw a good variety of birds including Yellow-headed Blackbird, Red-necked Phalarope, and Black-necked Stilt.  Toward the end of my walk I saw a small raptor perched in a tree.  It was a good ways off, and I couldn't quite see what it was on the back of the camera after taking a few photos.  But I was carrying my spotting scope, and it provided much better views.  It was quite light in color overall, and didn't have any prominent black mustache.  I was hoping it was a Merlin... and after reviewing the photos it appears to be a "Prairie" subspecies of Merlin: a lifer!<br/><br/>The next day, the conditions and timing were pretty good for a trip to the coast.  Almost immediately upon arriving, I trained my binoculars on a large dark long-necked bird... it turned out to be not a cormorant but a new county bird: Brant!  I managed to switch to my camera and take a few shots (above all I'm collecting photos of county birds).  After a quick scan of the area afterwards I didn't notice any large gatherings of scoters or loons or anything, nor any large groups of peeps running along the shoreline.  But a small brownish bird caught my eye.  It immediately seemed to be something unusual for me.  I was hoping it was a Black-bellied Plover, which would be a new lifer, but it didn't look right.  After a quick look at some candidate species in the Merlin app it appeared to be a female breeding plumage Pacific Golden-Plover!  This would be a more rare bird, and a lifer as well.<br/><br/>I spent much of the next half hour watching this bird, and trying to get a good photo of it.  I tried getting low, and even laying in the sand, but the sunlight was too strong.  There was a lot of heat shimmer in the air and just about all of my photos were really soft.  I figured I only had a shot to get a sharp photo if I took a lot of exposures, so I went to town and ended up with about 1,500 shots of this bird.<br/><br/>Some time later, some other beachgoers spooked the bird up onto the jetty where I was standing.  I got some eye-level shots with much less heat shimmer, albeit shooting toward the sun.  I then climbed down the jetty and circled around and managed to get some shots with the sun at my back.<br/><br/>This plover was very cooperative, and the beach and jetty were very quiet &mdash; she wasn't disturbed by any people or dogs aside from the one occasion when she flew up onto the jetty.  She sat still for long stretches, and wasn't really foraging.  I am guessing she was just resting up for a while before continuing north to her breeding grounds somewhere in the arctic.<br/><br/>To cap things off, as I was heading back to the car, I found my third county bird and second lifer of the day: Marbled Murrelet.  This bird was small but not as small as I was expecting.  I didn't get a great photo but it was great to finally find one and watch it fish for a while.
