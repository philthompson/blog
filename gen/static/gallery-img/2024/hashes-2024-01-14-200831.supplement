shoot:description:On several recent trips out to see potential county and lifer birds, I was only successful once: I had a great encounter with a Say's Phoebe.  I'd seen this bird once previously, where I only got a poor photo, so this wasn't technically a lifer.  But I got a much better view this time, and better photos.  I was very lucky to get so close to this bird.  It appeared right at the very edge a huge field, at the right time, right where I was standing.  It flew around from perch to perch for a few minutes, and it sat still for a little while upon each perch.  I like watching Black Phoebes fly around and do their thing, and this Say's Phoebe behaved similarly.  I typically see Black Phoebes right at the water's edge, and this one, as expected, was away from water in a field.  What a memorable experience!<br/><br/>I was also fortunate enough to see a Bewick's Wren in my yard.  This is a super common bird here, but for some reason I've only seen one twice now in my yard.  I was able to take a nice shot of this bird as well, improving upon my best yard photo for this wren.<br/><br/>I also got a little carried away snapping photos of a Brown Creeper making its way up the tree next to our deck.  When they're just a couple feet away it's hard to resist taking photos!  I got some shots where it's holding a little red spider in its bill, which I never would have known if not for the photos.
