shoot:description:I've now made three trips out to see a Northern Mockingbird (rare for Oregon), and only on the second try (where I was helped by some local birders) did I actually see it.  I've seen/heard them when I lived on the east coast but not since.<br/><br/>I was also lucky enough to photograph a Blue-gray Gnatcatcher on my first attempt this year.  These birds apparently migrate back to the exact same little spot for nesting, and it was very rewarding to go out and find one there again.
