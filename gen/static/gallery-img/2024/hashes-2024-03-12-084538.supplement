shoot:description:Red-shouldered Hawks have been very active around the house lately.  The one in this gallery was quite a ways off but I was able to capture it on a snowy tree, which made for a nice habitat shot.<br/><br/>I returned to a nearby lake to look for a Horned Grebe, and this time I found some!  A new county bird for me.  I also got some out-of-the-ordinary shots including some Greater Scaups and a group of Double-crested Cormorants flying right at me.
