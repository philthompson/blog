shoot:description:I returned to the coast to look for "fall" migrants.  I didn't see any but in hindsight I didn't spend any time looking out to sea!  I should have done some scanning of the horizon with my scope &mdash; perhaps I'll remember for next time.  On the other hand if I did happen to see some distant migrating sea birds I'm not sure I'd be able to ID them anyway.<br/><br/>I did see some good birds on the rocks including a bunch of Black Turnstones, several Wandering Tattlers, and one particular Pigeon Guillemot that flew in and landed nice and close for a photo opportunity.  The highlight of this trip were my first photos of Hermit Warbler.  I wasn't expecting to see them, but some were down close to eye level along with a few other warbler species.  There was an adult feeding an immature/juvenile.  I watched them for a while and was able to get a couple decent shots.
