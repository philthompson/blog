shoot:description:It's been cold and dry here, and I am fortunate to have seen a few good birds recently including Short-billed Gull on a brief visit to the coast and Snowy Owl on another trip.  Snowy Egret and Barn Swallow were also flagged as rare in eBird.  I also got good looks at a pair of lifer Trumpeter Swans!

The tail also ends with a pale brown band, not a dark band or dark band with white edge.  The legs are certainly skinny and the eye doesn't have the fierce brow appearance of a Cooper's.
