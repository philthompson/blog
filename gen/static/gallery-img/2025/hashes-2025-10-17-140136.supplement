shoot:description:I had an unexpected encounter with a group of Wrentits, and ended up with some decent shots despite the lack of light.  I experimented with animated images (APNG and WEBP formats) and might be able to post them here.  I also made a couple brief visits to the coast and got photos of Short-billed Gull and Heermann's Gull, neither of which I was able to ID until after looking at the photos later.  I had studied up a little beforehand and was able to spot and photograph some lifer Sooty Shearwaters.  They weren't that close to shore, but they were fairly easy to find.  I hope to get better photos of them someday, perhaps from a pelagic tour boat.
