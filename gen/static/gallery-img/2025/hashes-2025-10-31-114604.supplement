shoot:description:I did a little backyard shooting with my 200mm lens, at f/3.5.  It works fine for birds in the yard, when I can get close.<br/><br/>On other outings with my normal 200-800 I was able to find some sparrows to shoot: a Fox Sparrow (uncommon here) and a Harris's Sparrow (rare here).  I also saw a couple dozen California Quail flying briefly together, which was pretty cool!  (I don't know how they're able to run as fast as they do!)
