2025-11-06-085654-47-R5PT8512-stacked31-sigmas1pt1-scaled3-sm.jpg:description:This gull was about 3,475 feet away, and I couldn't ID it.  On the computer later I noticed I had 31 decently sharp frames, so I tried my upscaling (crude "drizzle") and alignment code on the 31 images.  I ended up with this shot with 9x the pixels of each individual stacked frame, and a decent amount of detail revealed, but I still couldn't ID the gull.  It looks like an Olympic Gull (Western/Glaucous-winged hybrid): Western Gull but with wingtips that aren't black enough, but I can't be sure.
