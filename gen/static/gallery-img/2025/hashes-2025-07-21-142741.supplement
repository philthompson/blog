shoot:description:In this gallery I've got a few photos from the coast I forgot to include in the last gallery.  We've also had a few visits from female turkeys with their chicks, and I was able to get some photos in our yard.  The final birding walk in this gallery includes a strange sparrow that caught my eye.  Any sparrow with a mostly plain breast (aside from White- and Golden-crowned Sparrows) is unusual around here, so I took a few photos.  I eventually settled upon it being an unusual Savannah Sparrow rather than something more rare.  Still a nifty bird.

2025-07-19-064555-57-R5PT9683-sm.jpg:description:This sparrow doesn't match terribly closely with anything, but Savannah Sparrow seems to be the best.  I'm not terribly familiar with what immature Savannah Sparrows look like, but this was the same size as a Savannah and hanging out with a few of them.  It seems to have some Lincoln's Sparrow buffy color and fine markings on the breast, but moreso has the expected facial pattern of a Savannah (minus the yellow above the eye).  The bill seems to fit Savannah.  It's too small for a Vesper, and the tail isn't long enough for Clay-colored.  The breast also isn't match for Clay-colored.  Aside from the flanks, it matches nicely with the "Ipswich" Savannah Sparrow photos in the Macaulay Library, but those are found on Sable Island off the east coast of Nova Scotia this time of year... so I'm not sure what's going on with this bird.  Again, it's likely just an immature Savannah Sparrow, similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/621155236">this (minus the yellow above the eye)</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/467921491">this (again, aside from the yellow)</a>.
