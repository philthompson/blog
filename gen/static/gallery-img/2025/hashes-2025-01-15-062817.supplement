shoot:description:Some great birds have been visiting my neck of the woods, and I was able to get out to see them.  A cooperative Costa's Hummingbird was the easiest to see.  He appeared after just a few minutes waiting near a feeder, much easier than last January's Costa's.  And as a bonus a local birder pointed out where a Barrow's Goldeneye has been hanging out in the river.<br/><br/>I wasn't quite as lucky with the American Tree Sparrow.  I first went to find this common eastern species and came up empty.  When I returned a couple days later I was able to find it, and managed to get decent photos despite the bright overcast conditions.<br/><br/>Lastly, on the following day, I spotted my target Lewis's Woodpecker after standing out in the cold for an hour.  Another great bird!
