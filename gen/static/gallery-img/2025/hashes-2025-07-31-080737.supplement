shoot:description:To close out July I've got photos from four birding outings.  First, I went looking for a locally-rare Red-eyed Vireo and didn't find it, but got some decent shots of Bushtits before coming upon a pair of male Pileated Woodpeckers.  Those birds are always fun to watch.<br/><br/>This is the time of year for rare shorebirds to sporadically appear at the local wetlands.  The other three outings shown here are all at the wetlands.  On the 22nd I saw some juvenile Black Terns begging for food and being fed by adults.  A couple birders pointed out a male Pacific-golden Plover that I had overlooked.  He was seen the previous day in the same location so I wasn't really expecting him to still be there.  A couple days later I returned and didn't find anything terribly noteworthy, but I did see a Lesser Yellowlegs, which are uncommon here.  It came pretty close to me at one point, and I got my best ever photos of this species.  I went back to the wetlands yesterday, and once again didn't spot any rare migrants but did get to watch a Wilson's Snipe feeding in the open for a while, and got my best ever photos of one of those.

When spooked, they usually just sink beneath the surface but sometimes they run across the water and flap their wings a few times.  Otherwise they're pretty much never seen flying.
