shoot:description:I made a short drive to see a Burrowing Owl, and another to see a Baikal Teal.<br/><br/>The Burrowing Owl had been reported on a farm field, so I wasn't too optimistic about finding it.  I got there on a cold morning with some fog in the area.  I was scanning the fields with my binoculars and stumbled across it peeking over the side of the road at me!  I got a few photos of the top half of the owl, but as I slowly made my way around to try to get a clear view some thick fog rolled in!  I returned a few days later and wasn't able to find it.  It was a fun lifer to get to watch for a few minutes.  I hope to see a group of them hunting one day.<br/><br/>There have been several Baikal Teal sightings in Oregon this month, which is exciting because this is a bird normally found in east Asia.  I made the short drive and spent the morning, with a couple dozen other birders, trying to find this bird among a flock of 1,500 other ducks.  Over the three hours I was there nobody spotted it.  I took a few photos of the flock while at rest and while flying, but I couldn't find it among all the other ducks in the photos.  Maybe someday an AI tool will be able to identify all the unique bird species in a photo of a flock.<br/><br/>Another recent highlight was an outing to photograph a very cooperative Costa's Hummingbird.  On that same outing I was lucky to stumble across a Hammond's Flycatcher that was known to be in the area.  This flycatcher is thousands of miles north of its normal winter range in central America!
