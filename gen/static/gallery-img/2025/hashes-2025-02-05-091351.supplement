shoot:description:A local birder told me the location of a Barred Owl, so I went out in the rain to try to find it.  Even when knowing where it was, it would be easy to overlook.  After finding the owl, I used silent shooting mode on my mirrorless camera and took only a few shots before stepping away.  I was looking up at the owl from underneath, so it wasn't worth waiting for a good shot anyway.  I spent a few minutes after that trying to get a view of it, and perhaps its face, from farther away.  After walking all around the tree and lots of scanning with binoculars I wasn't able to get a view of it.  I wonder how many owls I've walked right by without knowing.<br/><br/>The M31 Andromeda Galaxy shot here was a test untracked shot with the Canon RF 85mm F2 MACRO IS STM lens.  It's a stack of 149 frames of 1.3s, at f/2 and ISO 1600, for total of about 3.2 minutes of data.
