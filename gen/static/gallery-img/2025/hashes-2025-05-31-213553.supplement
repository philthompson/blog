shoot:description:To close out the month of May I've got a few fun shots to share, including some lucky photos of a Blue-gray Gnatcatcher out on a perfect perch.  I went out a few times to look for an Ash-throated Flycatcher and didn't see it, and I also missed a Wilson's Phalarope.  Butterfly and dragonfly (and damselfly) season has begun here, so when I get the chance I figure I might as well get shots of them too.

2025-05-24-M101-sm.jpg:description:This is my first ever shot of Messier 101, the Pinwheel Galaxy.  I shot it over three nights, totalling 13 hours of data, with my Seestar S30.  I'm a bit disappointed in the elongated stars in its images, but on the other hand this little telesope has allowed me to pretty easily take astro images more easily than ever.  I'll update this gallery with a link to a full size version of this image once I've uploaded it to Astrobin.

2025-05-30-101028-65-R5PT8132-sm.jpg:description:I saw a juvenile Virginia Rail in the distance (an entirely black fuzz ball with awkward big long legs) but it ran into the reeds before I could get close enough for a shot.  There was so much heat shimmer that I wouldn't have been able to get a good shot anyway.  I did end up with a few bad shots of adult Virginia Rails.
