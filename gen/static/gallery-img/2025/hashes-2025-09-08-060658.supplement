shoot:description:On my third trip out to look for them, on three separate days, I was in the right place at the right time to see my lifer Solitary Sandpiper.  There were actually two.  They were feeding right up along a boardwalk in a park, allowing me to get great looks and very close photos &mdash; this doesn't usually happen with lifer shorebirds!<br/><br/>I was able to head to a lake later that morning and see my lifer Sabine's Gull, with its terrific wing pattern and flight pattern of repeated tern-like dives down to the water.<br/><br/>To round out the trifecta for this gallery, I was able to see my lifer Ruff on my second attempt.  This bird involved a lot of walking in mosquito-clouded heat, twice, but it was worth it!  Ruff is terrific eurasian species with unusual breeding plumage and behaviors.  They seem to fairly regularly take a wrong turn and end up in the US during fall migration.  Like the Solidary Sandpipers and Sabine's Gull, the Ruff was pretty easy to distinguish from all the nearby usual suspects.<br/><br/>All of these birds are locally pretty rare, so I was fortunate to get to see them here in Oregon.
