shoot:description:I was able to get some photos of a pair of county birds: Swamp Sparrow and a lifer Hooded Warbler!<br/><br/>I was able to go and see the Hooded Warbler twice.  It was a state-level rarity, and on my first visit some birders there had already found it, which made getting a glimpse easier.  I only got a brief look with binoculars, so I returned a few days later and was able to find it on my own and get some challenging photos.  This bird was staying close to the ground, and in a residential area with dense vegetation and fenced off properties, so it was hard to actually see after locating it by ear.<br/><br/>I also made a pair of visits out to see the Swamp Sparrow.  After again locating this bird by ear, it briefly popped up among the cattails to fly a short distance.  I got to photograph it while hearing a second one calling in response.
