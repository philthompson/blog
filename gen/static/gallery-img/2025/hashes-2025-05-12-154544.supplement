shoot:description:We have birds and space in this gallery.<br/><br/>For birds, I got another chance to see a Lewis's Woodpecker, some decent shots of a Ring-necked Pheasant, and a few other good photo opportunites.  It seems like a quiet spring here in Oregon: there aren't many exciting warblers or flycatchers around this year.  I heard on the American Birding Association podcast that there was a recent drought in Mexico, and this may have affected populations of quite a few species, or at least their migration routes and timing.<br/><br/>For space stuff I again tried for an "HDR" Moon photo, and improved upon my last one a little.  I also got a new Seestar S30 smart telescope, so I'll be experimenting more with that when we have clear skies.

This one is my best yet, but there's still a lot of room for improvement.  I made separate stacks of frames shot at 1/20th, 1/50th, 1/100th, 1/200th, and 1/400th of a second.  I then blended the exposures together in Photoshop.  I'll make a more detailed post at AstroBin and put a link here.

2025-05-04-m81-1433x20s-sm.jpg:description:I tested out my new Seestar S30 on M 81 Bode's Galaxy (with the smaller M 82 Cigar Galaxy also visible).  This image represents about 8 hours of 20-second exposures, all shot with the Seestar "Plan" feature.  I'm happy with how this turned out!  I'll make a more detailed post at AstroBin and put a link here.
