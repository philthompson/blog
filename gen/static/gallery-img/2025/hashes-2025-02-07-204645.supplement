shoot:description:In recent days I was able to photograph (poorly) a pair of lifers: Canvasback and American Barn Owl.<br/><br/>The Canvasback was a tricky duck to pick out from among a couple hundred ducks, mostly because the Ruddy Duck has a similar bill profile from a distance, and because she kept diving down out of sight.  On the walk out to the ponds I took a bunch of photos of a talkative perching Northern Harrier.<br/><br/>I also went out looking for Rough-legged Hawk a couple times.  I came away with some shots of a Great Egret nabbing a rodent, possibly a pocket gopher, and also the Barn Owls.  The Barn Owls were more easily viewed with binoculars.  I don't expect to get better photos of one of those anytime soon.

2025-01-27-bg_r_c_pp30c30h_c_light_stacked-2-sm.jpg:description:M31 Andromeda Galaxy<br/><br/>I again shot M31 Andromeda at f/3.5 on the EF 200 f/2.8 L II.  This is a stack of the best 472 of 517 lights.  Each light frame was an 18s exposure, so this image represents 1.97 hours of data.  By previous best M31 image, from <a href="https://philthompson.me/gallery/gallery-2025-01-23-172019.html">a recent gallery here</a> and <a href="https://www.astrobin.com/0qs458/">on astrobin</a>, was made from 53 minutes of data.  The extra hour did reduce noise, and since I took so many light frames and the galaxy was drifting a bit in the frame across the session, I figured I should try Siril's 2x drizzle feature.  That did seem to help bring out even more fine detail in the image.  After I make another post to astrobin I'll provide a link here for more details and a full-size image.
