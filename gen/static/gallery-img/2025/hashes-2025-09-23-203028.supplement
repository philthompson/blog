shoot:description:A Stilt Sandpiper was reported locally, and I was able to go out and find it fairly easily.  Ideally it would have been out on some mud somewhere so I could see its namesake long legs, but a lifer's a lifer!  Besides that bird, I wandered around a little and ended up with a few photos capturing the late summer and early fall behaviors of birds here in the county.
