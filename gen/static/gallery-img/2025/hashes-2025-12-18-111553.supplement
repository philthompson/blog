shoot:description:It's been windy, rainy, and foggy here, and I've been busy on other things, but I did go out and get some fresh air and birding time recently.  A partially leucistic song sparrow caught my eye at the wetlands, and I ran into what I presume is the same Northern Shrike I saw recently.  It's always special to see these birds!  I saw a nice variety of birds on another outing at the local reservoir, including good numbers of one of the largest and heaviest flying birds in the world: American White Pelican.
