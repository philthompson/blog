shoot:description:To start things off I have my recent attempts at shooting M31, the Andromeda Galaxy.  I'll soon put more details up at my astrobin page and provide a link here.<br/><br/>A male Anna's Hummingbird has been consistently appearing at the feeder for the last few weeks.  I was able to get pretty close to the shots I wanted after waiting for a while near the feeder.  I used my reglar f/9 zoom lens, but it was kind of a dark afternoon.  I also experimented with a 200m f/2.8 lens since I was able to get pretty close without bothering him.  The faster aperture definitely allowed for a lower ISO: the shots of him hovering near the feeder were shot at ISO 4000 with the zoom lens (at f/6.3) and ISO 2000 with the prime lens (at f/3.2).  While waiting for him to fly down to drink or perch I was surprised to see a second male Anna's appear and get chased away.  Because they appear to have different preferred perches, and I'd been seeing them on both, I guess I had been seeing two separate individuals at the feeder.<br/><br/>Lastly, I have some photos from a quick trip to the coast.  I was quite cold and there weren't too many birds where I got the chance to check out the beach.  On a more sheltered inland bay I did get to see a few (at least 3) lifer Eared Grebes and a few other nice birds.

I shot the crow at f/14 but the Moon was still quite soft.  I gave the Moon a little blur in the composite to make it seem a little less artificial.

It came quite close to me but I didn't decide to unpack my camera from my bag in time to get a better shot.  Oh well!

2025-01-21-bgp2_stack_gesd_fwhmweighted-phil-2-sm.jpg:description:On the next night it was much more clear, and I shot 60 minutes of data.  I had to crop it quite a bit on this main image because I had a terrible ring artifact in the image, but the galaxy itself came out much better.  I am thinking the ring may be due to shooting at a wider f/3.5 aperture where f/4 the previous night seemed to work fine.  I am guessing a tiny amount of stray light was bouncing off the interior of the lens hood and onto the sensor.  The 18-second exposures, stacking an hour's worth of frames, and stretching of the data to see every little detail, might all work together to create the perfectly round ring artifact I was seeing.  More research is needed...
