shoot:description:April is now in the books with my first (terrible) shots of a MacGillivray's Warbler and a few first shots of the year for a few species.  At the coast, the highlight was a curious Harbor Seal.

2025-04-23-085953-38-R5PT5017-sm.jpg:description:I breifly got my first glimpse of a MacGillivray's Warbler through binoculars before it flitted out of sight.  I took a few photos of the area and was surprised to find it (though barely visible) in the photos.
2025-04-25-092537-64-R5PT5320-HDR-sm.jpg:description:I'd like the experiment with HDR photos, with more than 8 bits of color depth, but these are still not supported by eBird and iNaturalist.  Modern iPhones and iPads do support displaying HDR images, and Lightroom now also supports HDR, so it seems like it's worth editing and exporting some images in HDR mode.
2025-04-27-161536-30-R5PT5545-sm.jpg:description:A good shot of an Evening Grosbeak still eludes me, but on this occasion some visited our yard and a couple of them were actually visible in the trees overhead for a few seconds at a time.

2025-04-28-115808-68-R5PT6074-crop-sm.jpg:description:I don't think I'd seen Pacific Loons in their breeding plumage before.  Lots of little groups of 20-30 of them were headed north, flying low over the water.  I'm not sure if they migrate during the day, or at such a low altitude, but for what it's worth ChatGPT says they were likely migrating.

2025-04-28-121411-11-R5PT6294-sm.jpg:description:The right-most bird looks like a Least Sandpiper, but the rest are Western Sandpipers: they have slightly longer bills and brown triangle spots going farther down their flanks.
