shoot:description:It was over 90 degrees again, but there had been reports of Wilson's Phalaropes and there was a chance of seeing the rare Least Tern again, so I went back out to the local wetland the following evening.  My lifer Wilson's Phalaropes were thankfully very easy to find!  They appeared to be two males, so I'm not sure what they're doing migrating south already.  My Nat Geo field guide says females are commonly seen migrating south in June (because the males, not the females, raise young) so perhaps these males had an unsuccessful breeding season, or maybe they completed their breeding season duties a bit early.<br/><br/>I got a few photos from a brief trip to the coast as well.

It appeared too skinny to be a crow, and my first thought was Great-tailed Grackle.  I looked at the shots on the camera and couldn't see the light eye to confirm, so I had to wait until processing the image on the computer before it became clear that it was in fact the Grackle.
