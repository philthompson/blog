shoot:description:I've had a few good days of birding.  On the 5th, I got a new yard bird with photos: Red-shouldered Hawk.  The next day, I got a new lifer and yard bird again with photos: Sharp-shinned Hawk.  I knew Sharp-shinned Hawks are small but the one I saw was still unexpectedly tiny!  I ran inside to grab the camera and luckily I was able to spot it again when it flew up into a tree for a minute.  Two days after that, on a birding outing, I got another lifer: Fox Sparrow (Sooty), as well as my best shots yet of a Bewick's Wren.
