shoot:description:I am trying out a completely new photo workflow involving Lightroom Classic and Topaz Labs software.  Perhaps that warrants a blog post.  I tried re-processing some recent photos, and I also had a nice session on the water with some Grebes.<br/><br/>The water level at the lake was quite high for this time of year, and I was able to get right down near the water's edge.  Both Clark's and Western Grebes were occasionally surfacing near me, and it was overcast but the light was mostly coming from a good direction.  It was a really cool experience waiting by the water for these birds to appear.
