shoot:description:A Great Blue Heron stopped by the neighborhood in the afteroon one day.  It landed on a neighbor's roof, looked around for a minute, then flew across the street to another roof.  Our house is nowhere near any bodies of water, so needless to say it was my first sighting of one of these at the house.  I also saw a pair of Cinnamon Teals at the ponds, which eBird informed me was a rare sighting for this time of year.  Pretty cool.
