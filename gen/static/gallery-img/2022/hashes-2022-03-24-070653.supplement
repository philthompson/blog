shoot:description:I got some (bad) photos of a male Rufous Hummingbird at home, which was exciting.  The male(s) that migrate through don't visit my feeder, I don't think, so I've only caught glimpses of two of them in two years.  I also went on two walks at a local lake, where I finally got a decent shot of a Golden-crowned Kinglet, and some in-flight shots of a pair of Northern Harriers.
