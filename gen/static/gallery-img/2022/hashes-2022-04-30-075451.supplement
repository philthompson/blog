shoot:description:This gallery covers a busy several days' worth of shooting, with lots of spring migration birds.  I got my first photos of Ring-necked Pheasant, though I only had my iPhone (with lens attachment) on me.  Over the last few days I've noticed a lot of small birds flitting around high in the tall trees around my house, so I tried to photograph them (albeit silhouetted against a bright overcast sky) and was pleasantly surprised to get a few new yard birds!  We had Yellow-rumped Warblers (Audobon's), a Black-throated Gray Warbler (also a new lifer!), and a Lazuli Bunting.  I also got my first in-yard photos of a Wilson's Warbler.  On two different days I also saw a male Black-headed Grosbeak, the first of the year, gorging itself on the feeders.  Lastly, I finally saw a House Finch at the finch feeder I've had for many months now.

I've seen Flickers in and around the cavity for weeks now, but over the last couple days the Starlings have barged in.  I even saw a Starling inside the cavity.  I'd guess the Flickers have abandoned it as a potential nest location, which is unfortunate.  Last year a pair of Red-breasted Sapsuckers, and a baby Sapsucker, nested here.
