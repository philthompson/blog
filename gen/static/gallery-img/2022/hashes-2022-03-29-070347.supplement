shoot:description:In the previous shoot gallery, I said male Rufous Hummingbirds don't visit my feeder.  Well, the very next day, one finally did!  The guy below arrived at the feeder while the sun was shining and I was able to get some shots.  He hung out at the feeder all evening and then returned early in the morning.  I saw at least one or two other male Rufous Hummingbirds in the days after but they didn't visit the feeder.  So perhaps this guy was unusual.<br/><br/>I also got some good shots of a female Rufous Hummingbird and in the days following, some chickadees and a new county bird: Western Bluebird.
