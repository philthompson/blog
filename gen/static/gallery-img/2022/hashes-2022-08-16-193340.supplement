shoot:description:On August 11th, we had every kind of woodpecker I've ever seen in the yard, apart from Pileated, visit the yard all at once.  We had a Downy, a Hairy, a couple Red-breasted Sapsuckers, and several Northern Flickers.<br/><br/>I had the opportunity to visit the coast a few days later, and I was lucky enough to see several new lifers and county birds there.<br/><br/>I was finally able to conclusively identify some Western Sandpipers and add that one to the life list.  I also saw a Marbled Godwit (which wasn't as big as I was expecting).  California Gull had also somehow previously eluded my life list.  I also added Pacific Loon to my life list, though it was a poor picture of a distant bird.<br/><br/>Lastly, I took my best photos yet of a Black Oystercatcher, though none of the photos were as sharp as I was expecting.  My shutter speed was fine, and the conditions were great, but something was off.  I'm hoping that I left the focus limiter enabled on the lens or something.  Either way, I enjoyed watching the Oystercatcher for a while.
