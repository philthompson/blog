shoot:description:This gallery has photos from a couple birding outings and from a few different days in the yard this month.<br/><br/>The highlight for me was finally finding a lifer White-throated Sparrow.  I got to spend a few minutes taking photos of one that was hanging out with a bunch of Golden-crowned Sparrows.<br/><br/>I also got some through-the-window shots of a Townsend's Warbler that turned out ok, and some nice shots of Northern Flickers.
