shoot:description:Again down at the jetty, at the coast, I saw the run-of-the-mill birds as well as one Marbled Godwit.  I was hoping to see some some new lifer alcids or shorebirds, but it wasn't in the cards.<br/><br/>Earlier in the day, while walking on the beach, I came across a Marbled Godwit.  There were people very close to it so perhaps it would have been a good photo opportunity, but I didn't have my camera at that time.  After waiting around at the jetty for a while to see what would turn up, another (the same?) Marbled Godwit flew in and landed next to the Great Blue Heron that was fishing there.
