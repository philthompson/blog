shoot:description:This gallery has a few recent birding outings, as well as some backyard shots.  We have a tree with berries right outside a window, and that's where I finally saw my first Cedar Waxwings at the house.  The tree first attracted a bunch of Robins, which over the course of a few days became more and more numerous.  I normally see one or two Robins in the yard only a few times per year, but we had ten or more Robins in the yard at once going crazy for the berries.  All that activity must have attracted the Waxwings.
