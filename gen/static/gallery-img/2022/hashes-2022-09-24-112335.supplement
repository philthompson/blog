shoot:description:The first two photos here are re-processed older photos, done with Topaz Sharpen AI and Lightroom, which came out a bit sharper.<br/><br/>The rest of the photos are from a trip down to the ponds.  I shot an American Coot out of the water, with feet visible, I think for the first time.  Those photos aren't terrific but it was cool to finally see that.<br/><br/>The highlight of the outing was the Green Heron.  It stuck out its neck, leapt into the water, snagged a good-sized fish, swallowed it, and puffed itself up, and I got decent photos of the whole thing.  It was awesome to see it in action.

The bird itself is all just one photo, but the surrounding pond surface and wooden log were from other shots.  After manually (close enough) aligning the photos and cutting out portions of each I didn't want to end up in the final shot, I used auto-align and then auto-merge and got good results.  Some adjacent areas in the final image looked strangely soft and sharp, so in Lightroom I applied some extra blurring to large areas of the image to make the whole thing seem to have a cohesive depth of field.
