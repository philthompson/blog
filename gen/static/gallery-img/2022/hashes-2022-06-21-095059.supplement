shoot:description:This gallery has some photos from a walk in the woods near home, where I saw a group of Hairy Woodpeckers, and from another birding outing at Odell Lake where I saw my first American Dipper.  I had a great time watching the Dipper.  It was very skilled at snatching invertabrates from a fast-moving stream and smacking them on a log to get at the edible parts.
