shoot:description:Down at the jetty, again at the coast, there was a small variety of birds.  I got some decent shots but mostly just enjoyed watching the Black Oystercatchers get bothered by a Great Blue Heron, there was a small group of Least Sandpiper, and a Black Phoebe.<br/><br/>I'm still learning how best to use Lightoom and the Topaz Labs software.  It seems I'm having the best results by first processing my images with DxO PureRAW, which does a nice job of removing noise without generating strange artifacts in places or sharpening areas that are outside the depth of field (unlike Topaz Sharpen AI).  I can then use Topaz Sharpen AI to selectively sharpen just the bird itself.<br/><br/>The lighthouse shot is a focus-stacked image of two shots, which I shot handheld and auto-aligned in Photoshop.
