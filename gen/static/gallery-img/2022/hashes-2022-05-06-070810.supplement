shoot:description:Migration season is in full swing.  I spent a couple hours birding along the river, and was lucky enough to see lots of warblers and a few Western Tanagers.  In the two days before that outing, I had my first yard sighting of an American Goldfinch, and the first yard Cooper's Hawk of the year.<br/><br/>On the river outing, I saw many Wilson's Warblers but didn't get the clean profile shot I was hoping for.  They simply do not stop moving around!  I improved upon my best shots of an Orange-crowned Warbler and Black-throated Gray Warbler, and got a new lifer, the Warbling Vireo.  I also got some decent shots of a Red-tailed Hawk.  But the shots that came out the best were of a male Mallard and some Canada Goose goslings.
