shoot:description:I had some opportunities to go birding at the coast.  The outings were a little disappointing &mdash; I think I needed to go out in the afternoon, not first thing in the morning.  I still ended up with a handful of new county birds and a few new lifers: Black Scoter, Common Loon, and Black-legged Kittiwake.  I especially liked the Kittiwake.  I spotted it from afar with binoculars among a group of other gulls on the beach, and was able to find it again when I got closer with my camera.
