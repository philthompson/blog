shoot:description:I made an early morning trip out to the local wildlife area just after sunrise.  It was a very warm sunny morning.  Several Black Terns were hunting/fishing, and I got a few shots of them.  My shutter speed was too slow for the best photo opportunities but I did get a few keepers.  A Ring-billed Gull, a new lifer for me, made a quick flyover at one point.  As I was headed back to the car a Yellow-headed Blackbird, also a new lifer, flew overhead and briefly hovered in place above me.  I'd been looking for this bird the last few outings to this location so it was great to finally see one!
