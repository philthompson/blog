shoot:description:I had some more Western Tanagers visiting the yard (they are hanging around a lot more than last year) as well as a nice trip out to the wildlife preserve, where I saw (at a distance)  some Redhead ducks, a new lifer.  I also had a couple quick glimpses at some Yellow Warblers, a new county bird.
