shoot:description:We had a new yard bird visit the feeder and birdbath the other day, a Band-tailed Pigeon.  I've previously seen these but only at quite a distance.  It was quite a nice looking bird.  These photos were taken through a window.

The two photos were nearly identical other than where they were sharp, so it was quick and easy to make this composite image.
