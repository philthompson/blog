shoot:description:I spent a while in the morning at the ponds, and I saw a good number of species.  Notable birds were the young Bald Eagle that made a few low passes over the river footbridge I was standing on, a group of Lesser Scaup in the river (lifer for me), a California Scrub-Jay that posed nicely, and a Yellow-Shafted x Red-Shafted Northern Flicker.  A Gadwall had more interesting head/neck plumage than I've seen, and the bird generated a lot of discussion on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbird/comments/sus8ib) and with the helpful info there I'm fairly satisfied with it just being a Gadwall and not some Gadwall hybrid.
