shoot:description:This gallery covers a week's worth of birding, mostly at home but I did head out to the lake as well.  I saw my first Western Tanagers of the year at home, spotted on each of several days.  A Cooper's Hawk, with bird feathers still stuck to its talons, landed on the bird feeder pole and scared them away on one occasion.  I also got some (pretty bad) photos of Evening Grosbeak, another first of the year.  I also saw a new yard bird, Warbling Vireo, and got photos.<br/><br/>My favorite photo from the lake trip was the American Crow and Common Raven in flight photo, where you can see the size difference, how the Raven's outer tail feathers are shorter than the middle ones, how the Raven has a proportionally larger bill, and the Raven's shaggy throat.  There were three juvenile Bald Eagles flying around but I didn't get any good photos of them.  I also saw a flycatcher, though I don't know if it's a Hammond's, a Dusky, or a Gray.
