shoot:description:I enjoyed a quiet walk down at the ponds.  I finally saw and photographed a new county bird for me, American Goldfinch.  I can't believe it took so long to see one of these here.  I also finally got a photo of some Cackling Geese.  I've seen them in large numbers here and there around town but never with my camera.  Also of note was a Bushtit building a nest, which I haven't seen before.
