shoot:description:I went out looking for White-throated Sparrow and again didn't find any.  I did get a good low-light shot of a Pacific Wren.  I also saw a Thrush, which I think is an unusually-late Swainson's Thrush, along a trail.  Other unusual sightings for me were a group of Western Bluebirds, and a hybrid Yellow- and Red-shafted Northern Flicker.
