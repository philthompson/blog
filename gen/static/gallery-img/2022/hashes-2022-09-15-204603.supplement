shoot:description:We had a clear night at the coast, so I took the opportunity to capture some moon shots (no tracker, but used a tripod).  I stacked the top 24 of 62 frames in AutoStakkert, and sharpened with RegiStax.  Some final adjustments were made in Lightroom.<br/><br/>I also experimented with taking some shots as the moon was setting over the Pacific, and unexpectedly got some fireworks as well.
