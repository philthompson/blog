shoot:description:This gallery is for several days' worth of birding.  I got a Hermit Thrush photo I really quite like, in the rain.  An improvement was made for my best shot of a Eurasian Collared-Dove, though still not a great shot.  The first (and likely only) Golden-crowned Sparrows of the year for my yard made an appearance.  Most importantly, I got my first shots of an Orange-crowned Warbler.  I've used the Merlin app to identified them nearby, by song alone, many times without having seen one.  On successive days I saw one down on the forest floor just before sunset and then at home through the kitchen window.  The photos from home are terrible but I'm glad I finally got them!
