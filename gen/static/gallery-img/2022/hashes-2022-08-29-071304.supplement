shoot:description:We had a female Wild Turkey and two babies visit the yard.  They spent a while eating birdseed off the ground.  The female then flew up onto our fence a few times, apparently looking for somewhere in our trees to roost for the night.  As we were watching out the window she flew from our fence right over our heads and landed loudly on our roof!  The young ones then also flew up onto a fence and, after carefully studing the surrounding trees, they each flew up onto a large tree branch.  It seems to me like all three of them picked a different tree to spend the night, but it got too dark and I couldn't see where they went after initially flying up into the trees.<br/><br/>The following morning, I happened to see all three together again, this time in the front yard.  So it does seem like they spent the night here.<br/><br/>In processing these photos, I was really impressed by the Canon R6's low-light performance.  I shot most of these at ISO 5000 or 6400.  I also used Topaz DeNoise AI and Topaz Sharpen AI to clean them up, and altogether I am very happy with how well these shots turned out.
