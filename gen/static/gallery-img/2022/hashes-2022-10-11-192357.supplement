shoot:description:This gallery has photos from  two separate outings to the same location.  There were a few reports of would-be new lifers in the area, so I visited twice in 3 days.  I did manage to get a shot of a new lifer, Ruddy Duck!  It was a bit far away and hard to distinguish from all the other brown ducks while there in person, but after seeing the bird in the camera viewfinder, I really thought I did see one.  And the photos are unambiguously of a Ruddy Duck so I'm pretty happy to finally have photographed one.<br/><br/>I didn't get a picture of one, but I clearly heard (and recorded) several Virginia Rails on these outings, and the one recording was of a bird close enough (and without a lot of noise in the recording) for me to finally add Virginia Rail to my life list as well.
