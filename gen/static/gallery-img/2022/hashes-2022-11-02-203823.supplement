shoot:description:I went down to the local ponds to try to find some lifer Eared or Horned Grebes, or some White-throated Sparrows.  No luck on any of those.  One photo was inconclusive for the Grebes, so I had to return a couple days later to confirm that I did in fact not see an Eared or Horned Grebe.  Oh well.<br/><br/>I did however see a Sharp-shinned Hawk, which I've only ever seen once or twice before.  I also had a cool encounter with a Cooper's Hawk, who didn't mind my taking photos for a while before it flew down and out of sight under a boardwalk next to a pond.  It was making calls as well, which I don't think I've ever heard before.

While taking the photo I assumed it was just a common Pied-billed Grebe, but since its such a bad shot it was hard to tell when reviewing it later.  I returned to the pond a couple days later and found a few Pied-billed Grebes that have a similar black, reddish, and white neck.  I'm therefore assuming this was a Pied-billed.
