shoot:description:I went on a morning birding hike looking for a few target species, and actually got one!  A new lifer, Wrentit.  I noticed a couple small brown birds in some blackberry bushes, and one posed nicely for some photos.  Then they flitted out of view, with one singing the species's distinctive song a few times.  A couple other Wrentits in the distance responded to the song.<br/><br/>I also had a nice encounter with a slightly-molting male Lazuli Bunting in a bright sunny area.  I stuck around for a few minutes to get some shots of him.  Even with the Canon R6 at a -1.33EV exposure compensation setting, shooting in aperture priority mode, for the Lazuli Bunting shots in the strong sun it very nearly blew out some of the highlights.  If the exposure compensation had been even -1.0EV I bet it would have been over-exposed.  Perhaps I should try a different metering mode.
