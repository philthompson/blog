shoot:description:This gallery contains three separate birding shoots.<br/><br/>For the first, I tried to shoot some birds in my yard.  I positioned myself with the sun at my back and waited for them to come to the yard and visit the feeder.  I got some decent shots but I don't think there was enough light (the shots are a bit soft and noisy), and I don't particularly like the backgrounds of the shots where the birds are on the bird feeder pole.<br/><br/>On a different day, I noticed a Brown Creeper looking foraging on some trees in our yard so I waited and got a decent photo opportunity on a tree close to our deck.  Most of the shots were terribly out of focus but I got one shot I'm happy with.  Dealing with the very bright breast feathers of the Brown Creeper seems much easier in Lightroom than with darktable and its "filmic rgb" module.<br/><br/>For the last birding outing here, I went down to the wildlife preserve aiming to get a Pectoral Sandpiper, and was successful!  It was a new lifer for me.  There was one very actively feeding on a small patch of mud.  It was a good deal larger than the nearby Least and Western Sandpipers.  I also happened to get a nice shot of a Black-throated Gray Warbler.  Many of the ducks were Green-winged Teals, though I saw a few small groups of Blue-winged or Cinnamon teals as well.  I followed some American Goldfinches who were feeding on plant seeds, and got some shots I'm happy with.  It looked like they had an abundance of food.

I was able to use Photoshop's "content aware fill" to expand and fill in a couple hundred extra pixels at the top of the image, and I went around with the cloning brush to make it less obviously artificial.
