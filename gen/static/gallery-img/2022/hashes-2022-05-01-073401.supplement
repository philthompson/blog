shoot:description:Again just birding at the house, I got a new lifer, Vaux's Swift, and decent shots of a European Starling (likely one of them that invaded the Flicker nest cavity).

It was not easy to point the camera up between all the trees to get a shot of one in flight, but I think in this shot the bird is identifiable as a Vaux's Swift.
