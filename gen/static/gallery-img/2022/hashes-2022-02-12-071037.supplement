shoot:description:On this morning outing I saw and photographed three lifers: Red-shouldered Hawk, Lincoln's Sparrow, and American Kestrel.  I've seen quite a few Kestrels while driving around but not while birding.  This Kestrel was hunting and flying back and forth between a tree and a power/phone line, and I was able to get some decent shots.
