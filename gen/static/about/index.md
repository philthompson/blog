<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px" class="width-resp-25-40" src="../img/me.png" title="Me" alt="me" /> I’m a software developer in the Seattle area.  I enjoy running, nature, and tinkering with software.

I hope to publish informative, helpful articles to this blog, as well as document my personal projects.

I can be reached at "phil" at this domain.
