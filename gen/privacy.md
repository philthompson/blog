Throughout the Site, including in this Privacy Policy, the use of "we", "us" and "our" are references to the author(s) of the Site.

The headings used in this Privacy Policy are included for convenience only and will not limit or otherwise affect this Privacy Policy.

### Personal Information We Collect

When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.  Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site.  We refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information."

We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
    
* "Log files," which track actions occurring on the Site and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.

Third party sites may collect your Device Information using the following technologies:

* "Web beacons," "tags," and "pixels," which are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site, and
* "Cookies," which are small text files that may be read from or placed into your browser.

When we talk about "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we are talking Device Information.

### How Do We Use Your Personal Information?

We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating anonymized analytics about how our users browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).

### Sharing Your Personal Information

In general, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties.

However, we may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.

Due to our errors or those of our hosting provider, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed.

Third party sites may use and share your Personal Information according to and disclosed by their respective privacy policies.

### Do Not Track

We do not place first-party cookies in your browser nor perform any other web tracking behavior.  Since we do not track users in the first place, we do not alter our Siteâ€™s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.

Third party sites may implement their own Do Not Track signal policy, independent of this Site's policy, according to and disclosed by their respective privacy policies.

### Your Rights

If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.

Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information as described above in order to perform our own Site traffic analytics only.  Additionally, please note that since the web servers that power the Site are physically located in the United States, by visiting the Site your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including into the United States.

### Data Retention

Device Information, including IP address, web browser "user agent" strings, and other information, is temporarily stored in log files for a period up to two months.  After that time, all log files are anonymized (processed to remove personally identifiable information) and these anonymous log files are stored for the purpose of analyzing our Site traffic.  The log files containing the original Device Information as collected are never retained for a period longer than two months.

### Changes

We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
