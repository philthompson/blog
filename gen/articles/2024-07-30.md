If you don't pay for any of these streaming services I believe the YouTube one will allow you to listen for free.

It was a fun challenge to write lyrics, which I haven't done in a while.  Doing a concept album, to me, meant the lyrics for all the tracks should fit together and follow a story.  I released the album under the artist name "Hadonami" since... quite frankly it's a name that fits the genre but most importantly hadn't been already taken!

The album has been available since earlier this month, but after a bit of work and waiting the streaming providers should now be providing lyrics along with the music.  At the time of writing Apple Music is not showing lyrics for all the tracks, but
the lyrics are available via YouTube without a subscription.

I used <a target='_blank' href="https://suno.com/home">suno.com</a> to create the music.  In total it took a couple weeks of tinkering to finish the album, including generating about 500 short clips that had to be spliced together (or, more commonly, just thrown away) to end up with 5 finished tracks.  I had a lot of fun writing lyrics and experimenting with different music styles for each track.  The audio quality is not very good, but on the other hand it's amazing to me that this technology works at all.

This was a fun side project, including learning about how digital distribution works.  Thanks for checking it out!
