<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/img/20231005.jpg"/></a>  I've been working on code to calculate Elo ratings for NFL teams, and thus Elo-based power rankings, for the last couple weeks.

The power rankings page for the current season <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2023.html">is available here</a>.

### Background

I've been obsessed with 538's NFL power rankings, which also use an Elo rating-based system, during each NFL season for the last few years.  Through ongoing major upheaval at 538 this year, they are not publishing their NFL Elo ratings for the 2023 season.  After a few weeks without Elo ratings for this season I needed to set out to calculate them for myself.

After looking at the basics of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating system</a>, it seemed like a problem I could sink my teeth into.  The hardest part turned out to be gathering the data for games played.  I settled on using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2023_National_Football_League_season_by_team">Wikipedia data</a>, which has been fine for the most part.

Since it's a bit of a chore to process the data from prior seasons, and since I've noticed that data from more than a few years ago has a negligible impact on the current Elo ratings, my ratings for the 2023 season are based on the <del>2013</del> 2011 season (where all teams began with a rating of 1500) and onward.

I'll see how involved it is to keep the ratings page updated every week, but since I've been obsessed with NFL Elo ratings for the last few years, I'll likely want to keep them updated so that I can see the new ratings and power rankings for myself each week.

### Model Update October 16, 2023:

The initial Elo rating model (published Oct 4th, following week 4) used in these rankings was conservative, and slow-moving.  It received a lot of criticism from a vocal group on reddit (see my reddit posts following <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1704tdu/nfl_week_5_elo_power_rankings_oc/">week 4</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/174l02c/nfl_week_6_elo_power_rankings_oc/">week 5</a>) that prefers to see power rankings that reflect recent performance.  This seemed to be at odds with my goal.  I want to publish only the best, most accurate, and therefore most useful, Elo ratings.  I was not and still am not willing to change the model to create power rankings that look better but are less accurate.

A terrific aspect of the Elo rating system is that the model can be used to estimate game outcomes, and those estimates can be compared to actual game outcomes.  This allows the accuracy of the model to be measured.  If one model is less accurate than another model, the power rankings it produces are simply less meaningful.

With this in mind, over the last couple weeks I've been working on a model update that satisfies both criteria:

- reflect recent performance better (notably, the late 2022 and early 2023 Lions), and
- predict game winners and estimate margin of victory more accurately

I was able to make a few changes that did satisfy both criteria.  I published updated rankings here on this site on October 5th, and again was able to find a "better" and more accurate model that incorporated a stronger "offseason parity reset," published on October 10th.  The yardstick Detroit Lions climbed from 11th to 8th in the post-week 5 rankings.

Not satisfied, I tried a few more drastic changes.  Today, October 16th, I am again publishing updated rankings.  Again, the new model satisfies both criteria (with a caveat).  The Detroit Lions now climb from 8th to 6th in the post-week 5 rankings.  Aside from the Lions, other changes to the post-week 5 rankings include:

- the Bills drop from 1st to 2nd
- the 49ers move from 2nd to 1st
- the Dolphins move from 11th to 10th
- the Jaguars move from 17th to 14th
- the Jets move from 23rd to 20th
- the Ravens drop from 6th to 9th
- the Saints drop from 10th to 11th
- the Patriots drop from 21st to 26th

The Cowboys stay at 5th, interestingly.  Overall, the new model seems to rank the teams closer to where a human would.

The caveat is that while both the new model and the previous model pick 1822 winners correctly out of 2785 games since week 1 of the 2013 season, the previous model has a median "elo score" differential of 0.1152 over those games, where the new model has 0.1177.

The "elo score" applies to a single football game, and is adjusted to fit a 0.0 to 1.0 scale.  A team that gets "blown out" earns a 0.0, teams that tie earn a 0.5, and a team that wins in a blowout earns a score of 1.0.  The model calculates an estimated score between 0.0 and 1.0 for each team (the sum of both teams' scores is 1.0) and then it calculates the difference between the actual margin of victory and the estimated one.

The previous model had just as many games closer than 0.1152 to the estimate than farther from it, and the new model is slightly worse.

Because the new model really does rank the teams more responsively, and because it picks the same number of winners as the previous model, I'm going to go against my better judgement a little and switch to the new model for now.  The new model is also slightly simpler (one fewer parameter changes value during the season).

Over time, I imagine I'll keep playing with the models and hopefully I'll find an even better one.
