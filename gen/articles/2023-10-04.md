<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/img/20231005.jpg"/></a>  I've been working on code to calculate Elo ratings for NFL teams, and thus Elo-based power rankings, for the last couple weeks.

The power rankings page for the current season <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2023.html">is available here</a>.

### Background

I've been obsessed with 538's NFL power rankings, which also use an Elo rating-based system, during each NFL season for the last few years.  Through ongoing major upheaval at 538 this year, they are not publishing their NFL Elo ratings for the 2023 season.

After looking at the basics of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating system</a>, it seemed like a problem I could sink my teeth into.  The hardest part turned out to be gathering the data for games played.  I settled on using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2023_National_Football_League_season_by_team">Wikipedia data</a>, which has been fine for the most part.

Since it's a bit of a chore to process the data from prior seasons, and since I've noticed that data from more than a few years ago has a negligible impact on the current Elo ratings, my ratings for the 2023 season are based on the 2013 season (where all teams began with a rating of 1500) and onward.

I'll see how involved it is to keep the ratings page updated every week, but since I've been obsessed with NFL Elo ratings for the last few years, I'll likely want to keep them updated so that I can see the new ratings and power rankings for myself each week.
