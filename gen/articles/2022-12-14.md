<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/img/20221214.jpg"/></a> This is my first year trying the <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022">Advent of Code</a>.  I'll be keeping my journal here.

I'd heard about it on podcasts on the <a target="_blank" href="https://twit.tv">TWiT network</a> for a few years now (specifically, <a target="_blank" href="https://twit.tv/shows/security-now">Security Now</a>), and I'd like to see for myself how hard the puzzles get toward the end.

I am writing my solutions in python 3 &mdash; usually just the minimum effort to get the answer, perhaps with some comments here and there.  I am not looking for hints on reddit or anything, as the Advent of Code site suggests.  As I'm writing this now, I am stuck on Day 11's part 2 challenge, so I'll be staying away from reddit until I figure that out.

I've made my code available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/philthompson/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022">on GitHub</a>.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1">Day 1: Calorie Counting</a>: trivial.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2">Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors</a>: trivial.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3">Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization</a>: trivial.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4">Day 4: Camp Cleanup</a>: trivial
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5">Day 5: Supply Stacks</a>: was a tad harder.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6">Day 6: Tuning Trouble</a>: was easier than expected.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7">Day 7: No Space Left On Device</a>: was a bit more complex.  The trickiest part was finally realizing the puzzle solution was looking for directories of size "at most 100000," not "at least 100000."  So I've learned to read these specifications very closely.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8">Day 8: Treetop Tree House</a>: was straightforward, a bit easier than the previous day.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9">Day 9: Rope Bridge</a>: seemed to be not any easier or harder than Day 8.  For part 2, I thought we'd from one rope segment to two, not to 9!  this was as fun one
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10">Day 10: Cathode-Ray Tube</a>: was fun to implement.  Part 1 was pretty easy, and it very nicely set things up for part 2.  For part 2, it was a bit odd how the display pixels and cycles were numbered with a 1-based system, while a zero-based system was actually needed to get the proper result.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/11">Day 11: Monkey in the Middle</a>: was straightforward for part 1.  Part 2, on the other hand, seems impossible at the moment.  I must be missing something.  We are squaring some values on each iteration, so the worry reduction step cannot be a subtraction, right?  I wrote some code to brute force a bunch of tests.  I don't like how the “puzzle” is worded.  It's not clear.  I can think of a zillion ways to reduce worry, and I don't like how I am doing "guess and check" to try to duplicate the example results.  The worry reduction part should be more well-defined or bounded in some way.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/12">Day 12: Hill Climbing Algorithm</a>: was fun to solve.  I used a simple recursive function.  The input was large enough to exceed python's recursion depth limit, so I came up with a quick way to save function parameters/state out to a separate list and execute the recursion in smaller chunks.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/13">Day 13: Distress Signal</a>: might have been the most challenging so far, but still not too bad.  I had a little trouble with the "ran out of items to compare" situations but luckily I was able to spot my bug and finish both parts more quickly than expected.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/14">Day 14: Regolith Reservoir</a>: was another fun one.  I like these puzzles that are straightforward and produce some cool-looking output.
