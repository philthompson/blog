This will be fun.  I'll write about projects I'm working on.  Maybe I'll publish informative content here, or maybe just pictures of my dog.  Probably both.  Anyway.  Maybe it'll be helpful to someone.  But it's my new home on the web and it's not owned by some corporation.  I'm publishing it myself.  And who am I?  I've thrown up a page dancing around that subject [here](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/about).

The next post will go into detail about generating this site's pages.
