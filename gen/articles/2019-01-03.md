<img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="../img/20190103.jpg"/> Vanguard's "Asset mix" screen is useful, but often I'd like to see what my asset allocation looks like when cash is ignored.  To do this I could use a calculator and punch in a few values displayed on that screen, but there's a way to compute this adjusted asset allocation with a single click of the mouse: a bookmarklet.

Vanguard's website has a great "Asset mix" tab on the first screen shown after logging in.  This tab shows my portfolio allocation percentages of stocks, bonds, and "short-term reserves" (basically, cash).

For me, any "cash"-like assets I own are not related to my stocks versus bonds allocation.  I keep a set amount of cash for emergencies.  Therefore I would like to ignore the cash when viewing my asset allocation.  When ignoring the cash, hopefully that "76.3%" of stocks is actually closer to my target 85% for stocks.

I don't want to have to remember the exact formula to plug into a calculator whenever I want to see my cash-less adjusted asset allocation.  Instead I tinkered around and came up with a few lines of Javascript to compute the adjusted allocation percentages from the values displayed on the Asset mix screen.  To run the Javascript I created a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a>:

I created a bookmark in my browser called "Vanguard - Adjusted Asset Mix." 

I pasted the following Javascript in as the bookmark "URL":

	javascript:(function() {
	  var xyzStocksEl = document.querySelector("p.dataPoint.stocks > span.percentage");
	  var xyzBondsEl =  document.querySelector("p.dataPoint.bonds > span.percentage");
	  var xyzCashEl =  document.querySelector("p.dataPoint.cash > span.percentage");
	
	  var xyzStocksPct = xyzStocksEl.innerText.replace('%', '');
	  var xyzBondsPct = xyzBondsEl.innerText.replace('%', '');
	  var xyzCashPct = xyzCashEl.innerText.replace('%', '');
	
	  var xyzStocksPctAdj = Math.round(xyzStocksPct/(100.0 - xyzCashPct) * 100 * 100) / 100;
	  var xyzBondsPctAdj = Math.round(xyzBondsPct/(100.0 - xyzCashPct) * 100 * 100) / 100;
	
	  xyzStocksEl.title = 'adjusted ignoring cash: ' + xyzStocksPctAdj + '%';
	  xyzBondsEl.title = 'adjusted ignoring cash: ' + xyzBondsPctAdj + '%';
	
	  alert("Stocks, " + xyzStocksEl.title + "\nBonds, " + xyzBondsEl.title);
	})();

And that was is.  Now whenever I'm viewing Vanguard's "Asset mix" tab, I can simply click on the bookmark and the adjusted asset allocation will be displayed.

As expected, the adjusted percentages for stocks and bonds are basically right in line with my target.  And because it's easy to do with the bookmarklet, the "Stocks" and "Bonds" percentages are also updated to show their adjusted value when I hover the mouse cursor over them.

This exact bookmarklet will probably need to be tweaked from time to time as changes are made to Vanguards "Asset mix" screen, but for now this is a convenient one-click way for me to check my asset allocation.
