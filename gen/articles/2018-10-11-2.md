<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/img/20181011.jpg"/></a> I wanted a clean, simple site.  Blog-like.  Not powered by some bloated overwrought monstrosity of a blogging platform with security vulnerabilities and updates to install and plugins to manage.  Just a few web pages, not a Javascript web app.  I wanted scripts, written from scratch by myself, to generate the static site pages.  I didn't want to wrestle any sprawling web frameworks.  I wanted to stay away from making things complicated.  And you're reading the result.

[more](more://)

To make this site I started with some goals:

* write site generation code myself rather than learn an existing framework
* pages should be lightweight: minimal CSS and no Javascript if possible
* use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to make writing posts easier
* start with Bash (ahh!) scripts to generate the site, then move to probably Python if/when things start to get complex

And some more specific features I wanted to include:

* Home page with some number of snippets/previews of recent posts
* "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate between posts chronologically
* "Archive" pages to allow browsing posts by year
* Simple embedded images

For this first post, I'm going to walk through my thought process in building this site.  The source code is available in my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/philthompson/blog).

Inspiration
-----------

The main inspiration for this site is [zpjiang.me](http://zpjiang.me/).  I've been keeping my eye out for clean, minimalist sites for a while and this was my favorite I've seen.

Getting Started
---------------

I picked Bash scripts to generate the site.  But... *why?*  Because it's fast for me.  Because I can move and copy and write a bunch of files without fancy syntax.  And because I can call any number of scripts or programs easily.  As an added bonus, I can use [heredocs](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) as a simple template system for the pages' headers and footers.  Yes, I know heredocs aren't unique to Bash.

I grabbed [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) Perl script.

For a starting point for my site, I wrote a basic article page by hand, styles and all.  And because the site is simple and static, no server is needed during development.  I just opened the `.html` file in my browser to handcraft the page.

After I had the example page looking good, I created a directory structure for the project:

	gen/

	# static files will be copied as-is to the built site
	gen/static/
	gen/static/css/
	gen/static/css/normalize-8.0.0.css
	gen/static/css/style.css

	# Markdown files that will become articles
	gen/articles/

	# each build will be written to a new directory here
	out/

	# Markdown
	Markdown_1.0.1/

	# script to run to build the site
	build.sh

The initial `build.sh` script was basically a wrapper around a heredoc statement.  It output the static files and the page content:

	#!/bin/bash

	THIS_SCRIPT="${0}"
	THIS_DIR="$(dirname "${THIS_SCRIPT}")"
	OUT_DIR="${THIS_DIR}/out/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)"
	GEN_DIR="${THIS_DIR}/gen"
	STATIC_DIR="${THIS_DIR}/gen/static"

	# make new build output dir
	mkdir -p "${OUT_DIR}"

	# put static files in place
	cp -rp "${STATIC_DIR}"/* "${OUT_DIR}/"

	cat > "${OUT_DIR}/index.html" << xxxxxEOFxxxxx
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
		<head>
		...
		</head>
		<body>
		...
		</body>
	</html>
	xxxxxEOFxxxxx

Then I moved the common header and footer HTML tags from `build.sh` into separate `gen/header.sh` and `gen/footer.sh` scripts.  The body of the article could then be written using Markdown, between the header and footer:

	#!/bin/bash

	...

	"${GEN_DIR}/header.sh" > "${OUT_DIR}/index.html"

	perl "${MARKDOWN_PERL_SCRIPT}" --html4tags "${ARTICLE_MARKDOWN_FILE}" >> "${OUT_DIR}/index.html"

	"${GEN_DIR}/footer.sh" >> "${OUT_DIR}/index.html"

	...

Next I wanted to be able to process multiple Markdown files, one per article, and generate a separate page for each.  To do this, I embedded meta data about the article at the top of each file using a Markdown comment syntax:

	[//]: # (gen-title: Example Title)

	[//]: # (gen-title-url: Example-Title)

	[//]: # (gen-meta-end)

	This is the start of an article written in Markdown.

	...

The `gen-title` line can be used to the title to display on the page, and the `gen-title-url` can be used for the name of the HTML file itself.  Is this ugly?  Yes!  But does it work?  Yes!

I wanted to be able to sort articles by dates, so as a convention I just put each article's date in the filename in `YYYY-MM-DD-N` format, where `N` is the nth article written on that day.  With this in place the `build.sh` script could figure out the date and title of each article.  Then `build.sh` could loop over the article files and generate an `.html` file for each.  The HTML `<title>` was set by adding one CLI argument to the `header.sh` script:

	#!/bin/bash

	...

	find "${GEN_DIR}/articles" -type f | while read ARTICLE_MARKDOWN_FILE
	do

		ARTICLE_METADATA="$(grep -B 99 '^\[//\]: # (gen-meta-end)' "${ARTICLE_MARKDOWN_FILE}")"

		ARTICLE_TITLE="$(echo "${ARTICLE_METADATA}" | grep -m 1 gen-title: | cut -d ' ' -f 4- | sed 's/)$//')"
		ARTICLE_TITLE_URL="$(echo "${ARTICLE_METADATA}" | grep -m 1 gen-title-url: | cut -d ' ' -f 4- | sed 's/)$//')"

		ARTICLE_DATE="$(basename "${ARTICLE_MARKDOWN_FILE}" | cut -d . -f 1)"

		"${GEN_DIR}/header.sh" "${ARTICLE_TITLE}" > "${OUT_DIR}/${ARTICLE_TITLE_URL}.html"

		perl "${MARKDOWN_PERL_SCRIPT}" --html4tags "${ARTICLE_MARKDOWN_FILE}" >> "${OUT_DIR}/${ARTICLE_TITLE_URL}.html"

		"${GEN_DIR}/footer.sh" >> "${OUT_DIR}/${ARTICLE_TITLE_URL}.html"

	done

	...

You get the idea.  Nothing revolutionary.  But I can wrap my head around it and make tiny tweaks wherever I want.

Sprucing it Up
--------------

I played around with color palettes on [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) until I found one I liked.  I'm a terrible amateur in this department but that site worked really well.

In order to allow the color palette to be changed easily, I moved and renamed `gen/static/css/style.css` to `gen/style.sh` and converted it to a heredoc-based Bash script to output my custom `style.css` file.  The palette colors can simply be inserted everywhere as variables in the heredoc syntax:

	#!/bin/bash

	CLR_PAGE_BG="#eff1f3"
	CLR_TEXT_MAIN="#474e60"
	...

	cat << xxxxxEOFxxxxx
	body {
		margin: 0;
		color: ${CLR_TEXT_MAIN};
		background-color: ${CLR_PAGE_BG};
		font-size: 1.0rem;
		line-height: 1.6;
		font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
	}

	h1, h2, h3, .article-title {
		line-height: 1.3;
	}

	...
	xxxxxEOFxxxxx

After moving adding one line to `build.sh`, I now have variables in the style sheet:

	"${GEN_DIR}/style.sh" > "${OUT_DIR}/css/style.css"

For web hosting, I'm using Bluehost.  I've been a Bluehost customer for a couple months shy of 10 years now.  I can't say it's the best hosting company because I honestly haven't had experience with that many.  But 10 years later I *can* recommend them to anyone getting started with web hosting because they offer fixed-price hosting with unlimited bandwidth and they're easy to use.
