<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/s/img/2025/20250407.jpg"/></a> An update for my Diceware wordlist was long overdue.

I've posted a new 2025 version of my wordlist to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/philthompson/eff_diceware">my GitHub repository</a>.  Compared to my previous list, the new one has fewer inappropriate words (for a passphrase) and significantly shorter words on average.

My last Diceware wordlist, which I based on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases">a wordlist published by the EFF</a>, was created in 2019.  That wordlist averaged about 7 (6.98) characters per word.  A seven-word passphrase (with ~90 bits of entropy) averaged about 55 characters including the spaces between words.  The new version averages 5.48 characters per word, or 44 characters for a seven-word passphrase.

To improve the list I removed any words of 8 or more characters (of which there were 3,266!) and replaced them with short, 3-6 character common English words from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/">hermitdave's FrequencyWords repo</a>.  This took a lot of manual review of the words &mdash; I think it'll again be a few years before I have the motivation to improve this wordlist again, if ever.  A good portion of the new words could be added because I relaxed my 2019 "no plural versions of words" rule.

To more easily create passphrases containing uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters, I also created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/philthompson/eff_diceware/blob/master/lower_upper_digit_special-2025.txt">a separate wordlist</a>, that, though adding a digit or special character after each word, has an even shorter average word length at 4.76 characters per word.

See my <a href="/2019/Diceware-Passphrases.html">2019 Diceware post</a> for more background on Diceware passphrases.

### October 1, 2025 Update:

I've added a new 6-die wordlist.  It's a variant of the "-2025" wordlist that includes lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.  It allows, for example, creating 7-word passphrases with 108 bits of entropy, or 8-word passphrases with 124 bits.  The average character length is still short, at 4.76 characters per word, making typing the passphrases easy.  This new wordlist has been posted to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/philthompson/eff_diceware">GitHub repository</a>.
