<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/s/img/2025/2025-10-09-091657-94-R5PT2980-anim-1800x1200-fast.webp"/></a> A took a few photos of some Wrentits recently (full gallery <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/gallery/gallery-2025-10-17-140136.html">here</a>) and noticed that a couple of the bursts would work as animations.

I first edited all the frames identically in Lightroom Classic, then exported to TIFF files (JPG or whatever would work as well).

Next, in Photoshop, use "File" > "Scripts" > "Load Files into Stack..." to load the images as layers.  Use "Edit" > "Auto-Align Layers" to align the layers, then crop as desired.  Before exporting, use "Image" > "Image Size" to resize.  Finally, use "File" > "Export" > "Layers to Files..." to save the layers as separate JPG files. 

I already had <a target="_blank" href="https://imagemagick.org/">Image Magick</a> installed on my Mac (thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>), so creating a WebP format animation was as easy as running this terminal command:

	$ magick -delay 40 -loop 0 /.../path/to/input-images*.jpg /.../path/to/output.webp

It takes a few moments, but Image Magick writes a surprisingly small (lossy) animated `.webp` file.

Here's another one:
