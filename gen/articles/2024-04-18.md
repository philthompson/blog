<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/s/img/2024/2024-03-15-Moon-Stacked-Blended.jpg"/></a> For a while now I've wanted to make an HDR-style photo where both the sunlit and dark halves of the Moon are visible.  The half Moon was high overhead, and not obscured by clouds, on March 15th.  I took a bunch of photos and then tried to stitch them together.

### Final Image

Here is the result of 19 stacked dark-half frames and 85 stacked light-half frames.  Everything was shot on my Canon EOS R6, with the Sigma 150-600mm Contemporary with 1.4x, at 840mm, using f/9.  The dark-half frames were shot at ISO 3,200 at 1/4 second.  The light-half frames were shot at ISO 1,600 at 1/250th of a second.  (Click to see full-size):

### Processing

I first used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.darktable.org/">darktable 4.6.1</a>, with the "filmic rgb" module turned off, to cull the frames, crop them, and them from Canon CR3 files to TIFF.

Next, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220512133902/https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/">PIPP</a> was used to center the Moon in each frame, and then I stacked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.autostakkert.com/">AutoStakkert! 3</a> and its 1.5x drizzle algorithm.  I used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.astronomie.be/registax/">RegiStax 6</a> to sharpen the stacked result, and Lightroom Classic for some final sharpening and adjustments.

The middle border between the dark and light halves didn't work very well, so I had to resort to a very dark area there to conceal it.  I might have to experiment with exposure bracketing at many more points between the dark and light extremes to get a natural looking edge there.
