<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/img/20190111.jpg"/></a> What will happen to your password-protected accounts upon your death?  Will people you trust be able to access them?  Do you not feel safe just writing your passwords down?

This is probably a somewhat uncomfortable topic, but one that deserves some attention.  It turns out that we can solve this problem by "splitting" passwords on paper.  This article will show you how to do it.  No fancy software is needed, the instructions are simple enough to be included in your will, and it doesn't cost anything.

### Recovery

If you’re here to recover a passphrase, this article will introduce you to the process.  More information and wordlists are available [here](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/).

### What's Password Splitting?

Here's a simplified example.  Say this is our password (called a passphrase):

	delirious broaden sheep

We can "split" this passphrase across two sheets of paper.  This one is left in safe deposit box at bank:

	quickness exert july

and this one is kept in a fireproof safe:

	overrate sleep establish

As you can see, the two recovery phrases above look random.  They actually *are* random, and by themselves don't reveal anything about the original passphrase.  With the method described in this article, if both recovery phrases are combined, the original passphrase can be recovered.

### Which Passwords Should be Split?

Your financial accounts, and other property, will be bequeathed to your beneficiaries according to your designations and according to your will.  It’s essential to have this all in place and verified from time to time, so take care of this if you haven’t already.

However, you probably have some valuable password-protected accounts or other property that won’t be accessible by your beneficiaries.  Examples include valuable family photos and email records accessible only with

* smartphone passcodes,
* computer passwords, and
* Internet accounts.

These are the types of passwords we’re concerned with in this article.

Okay.  So you’d like a select few trusted people to have access to some password-protected  accounts once you can no longer access them yourself.  And you don’t want to just write your passwords down on paper.  Let’s solve this problem.

This method does not involve any fancy software or even a computer &mdash; split passwords can be recovered with a pen and paper.

## <a name="select-password"></a>Select a Password and Wordlist

If you have more than one password you'd like to secure with paper password splitting, it's easiest to put the passwords into a [password manager](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-password-managers/) (LastPass, KeePass, 1Password, or similar) then secure the password manager with a single master passphrase.  See the [Diceware article](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/2019/Diceware-Passphrases.html) for how to create a strong master passphrase &mdash; that master passphrase is the password we'll split.  *Note that if a password manager offers password recovery, that defeats the purpose of securely splitting its master passphrase on paper.  Don't choose a password manager that offers master password recovery.*

If you have an individual pass*phrase* you'd like to split, all the words in the phrase must appear in a numbered wordlist with both regular numbers and dice roll numbers.  If they don't, you'll either have to treat it like a regular pass*word* (see "If you have a regular password" below) or change to a new passphrase.  For a numbered wordlist, I recommend you use [my 2019 Diceware wordlist here](https://github.com/philthompson/eff_diceware/blob/master/eff_large_wordlist-2019.txt), which looks like this:

	number   dice      word
	...
	5030     46252     puzzle
	5031     46253     puzzling
	5032     46254     pyramid
	5033     46255     python
	5034     46256     quack
	...

If you have a regular pass*word* you'd like to split, you'll have to do more translating between characters and numbers than if you used a passphrase (a 40-character six-word passphrase translates to 6 numbers, whereas a twelve-character regular password translates to 12 numbers).  Pick a numbered ASCII character list ([this](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/ASCII-philthompson.me.txt) or [this](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/ASCII-Decimal-Values-Minus-31.txt)) and then in following along with this article, when a *whole passphrase word* is translated to or from a number, you will translate a *single character* from your password.  See the [Non-Diceware Password Splitting](#non-diceware) section for more details.

An [ASCII character list](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/ASCII-philthompson.me.txt) looks like this:

	number   dice           letter
	...
	27       153 or 432     a
	28       154 or 433     b
	29       155 or 434     c
	30       156 or 435     d
	31       161 or 436     e
	...

Once you have your passphrase to split, we can begin.

## <a name="split-2-of-2"></a>Split Into 2-of-2 Recovery Passphrases

Have your wordlist handy.  For this example, we're using [my 2019 wordlist](https://github.com/philthompson/eff_diceware/blob/master/eff_large_wordlist-2019.txt).

Let’s say we roll dice to make a random 3-word [Diceware passphrase](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/2019/Diceware-Passphrases.html), and we’ll call it the secret `S`.  We roll <span style="font-size: 2.0em; line-height: 0;">⚁⚁⚄⚅⚀</span>, <span style="font-size: 2.0em; line-height: 0;">⚀⚃⚁⚂⚂</span>, and <span style="font-size: 2.0em; line-height: 0;">⚄⚃⚁⚀⚄</span>

	Secret S
	1687    22561    delirious
	699     14233    broaden
	5873    54215    sheep

Using the line numbers from [my 2019 wordlist](https://github.com/philthompson/eff_diceware/blob/master/eff_large_wordlist-2019.txt), not the 5-digit dice numbers, we get

	Secret S
	delirious (1687) broaden (699) sheep (5873)

*Note that a three-word passphrase is **not** strong, and it used for these examples only.  Use at least six words in your real Diceware passphrases.*

To split `S` into two recovery phrases, both of which are needed to recover it (hence calling it "2-of-2"), we must roll dice again to create a new random 3-word passphrase that we’ll call recovery phrase `A1`.  Say after rolling dice we have

	Random Recovery Phrase A1
	quickness (5054) exert (2414) july (3518)

Now for each word in `S` we’ll subtract the corresponding word in recovery phrase `A1`.  If the result is not from 1-7776, we’ll add 7776 (this is called "subtracting modulo 7776").  Why 7776?  Because that's the number of words in the wordlist we're using.

	(S - A1) mod 7776
	 S: delirious (1687)  broaden (699)   sheep (5873)
	A1: quickness (5054)  exert   (2414)  july (3518)

	delirious (1687) - quickness (5054)
	1687 - 5054 → -3367 → -3367 + 7776 → overrate(4409)
	(since -3367 is less than 1, we add 7776 to get a number from 1-7776)

	broaden (699) - exert (2414)
	699 - 2414 → -1715 → -1715 + 7776 → sleep (6061)
	(since -1715 is less than 1, we add 7776 to get a number from 1-7776)

	sheep (5873) - july (3518)
	5873 - 3518 → establish (2355)

After subtracting the numeric values of the words we now have recovery phrase `A2`.

	Recovery Phrase A2
	overrate (4409) sleep (6061) establish (2355)

Recovery phrase `A1` is completely random, and phrase `A2` is indistinguishable from randomness on its own.  *But* if we take both recovery phrases *add* them we recover the original secret `S`!  When adding, we’ll simply subtract 7776 if any sum is larger than 7776:

	(A1 + A2) mod 7776
	A1: quickness (5054)  exert (2414)  july (3518)
	A2: overrate  (4409)  sleep (6061)  establish (2355)

	quickness (5054) + overrate (4409)
	5054 + 4409 → 9463 → 9463 - 7776 → delirious (1687)
	(since 9463 is larger than 7776, we subtract 7776 to get a number from 1-7776)

	exert (2414) + sleep (6061)
	2414 + 6061 → 8475 → 8475 - 7776 → broaden (699)
	(since 8475 is larger than 7776, we subtract 7776 to get a number from 1-7776)

	july (3518) + establish (2355)
	3518 + 2355 → sheep (5873)

After adding the recovery phrases `A1` and `A2`, we have recovered `S`:

	delirious broaden sheep

Let’s recap:

* we rolled dice to create secret `S` of `delirious broaden sheep`
* we rolled dice again to create recovery phrase `A1` of `quickness exert july`
* we subtracted `A1` from `S` to get recovery phrase `A2` of `overrate sleep establish`
* by adding `A1` and `A2`, we recovered `S`

We're back to the example at the beginning of this article.  We see that we can write down `quickness exert july` on one piece of paper, and `overrate sleep establish` on another piece of paper.  If we trust two people with those slips of paper, neither one of them has our secret passphrase.  If we also give them instructions, those two people could use a pen and paper to re-create the secret passphrase `S`.  That’s it!  If you want more background information on this method, this is called encryption with a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">one-time pad</a>.

## <a name="split-2-of-3"></a>Split Into 2-of-3 Recovery Passphrases

The above 2-of-2 method has a problem, though.  If *either* of the above recovery phrases is lost, the secret passphrase can never be recovered!  This doesn’t seem terribly reliable for safeguarding a secret for many years.

Let’s build upon our scheme to create a 2-of-3 system, where we create three pairs of recovery phrases.  If any one of the three is lost, the secret passphrase can still be recovered with the remaining two recovery phrases.  This is a more complex system, but it's more reliable.

To split a secret into three parts, any two of which can create the secret, we need to come up with three recovery phrases `A1`, `B1`, and `C1`, each of which is subtracted from the secret `S` to create phrases `A2`, `B2`, and `C2`.

From above, we have

	Secret S
	delirious (1687) broaden (699) sheep (5873)

	Random Recovery Phrase A1
	quickness (5054) exert (2414) july (3518)
	
	Resulting Recovery Phrase A2
	(S - A1) mod 7776
	overrate (4409) sleep (6061) establish (2355)

Let’s roll dice again to create recovery phrase `B1` then subtract to create `B2`

	Random Recovery Phrase B1
	anyplace (248) couch (1349) happiest (3132)
	
	Resulting Recovery Phrase B2
	(S - B1) mod 7776
	croon (1439) undying (7126) frightful (2741)

One more time, let’s roll dice to create `C1` then subtract to find `C2`

	Random Recovery Phrase C1
	outage (4305) malformed (3823) serpent (5823)
	
	Resulting Recovery Phrase C2
	(S - C1) mod 7776
	rebuttal (5158) petunia (4652) activist (50)

Now we have three pairs of recovery phrases, where each pair recovers `S`:

	(A1 + A2) mod 7776 → S
	(B1 + B2) mod 7776 → S
	(C1 + C2) mod 7776 → S

If you distribute those recovery phrases, like so, to three safe people or places:

	A1 and B1 go to safe place or person 1
	C1 and A2 go to safe place or person 2
	B2 and C2 go to safe place or person 3

then any two safe places or people together have one pair of recovery phrases `(A1 + A2)` or `(B1 + B2)` or `(C1 + C2)`.

This 2-of-3 method reduces the risk that your secret is lost forever.  In the above example, say "safe place or person 2" loses phrases `C1` and `A2` a fire, then the secret `S` can still be recovered using `(B1 + B2)`.

Next we'll discuss later exactly what a "safe place or person" is.

## <a name="select-safe-places"></a>Select Safe People or Places

If you're using 2-of-2 splitting, you'll need to choose two *different* safe places or people to trust your paper recovery phrases to.  And three if you're using 2-of-3 splitting.

Recommendations:

* Your filing cabinet along with your will or other valuable papers, or
* a fireproof safe, or
* trusted with a family member, or
* in a safe deposit box at your bank, or
* trusted with your family attorney.

If possible, it's recommended to choose people/locations in separate cities or at least separate buildings to minimize fire and other risks.

You can also choose to store one recovery phrase digitally (recommended only if using 2-of-3 splitting).  The only recommended place at the time of writing is in a document in Google Drive.  If your Google account goes inactive for some time (presumably after you've died or some other issue has arisen), Google can automatically provide access to your Google Drive to a designated person:

1. Fill out the text version of a recovery sheet (see below) for two recovery phrases (A1 and B1, or C1 and A2, or B2 and C2 as shown above)
1. Save the recovery sheet text documents to your Google Drive.
1. Set up your personal Google account's <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3036546?hl=en">Inactive Account Manager</a>
 * provide access to your Google Drive to your designated person
 * include instructions in the notification email to that person to "see my passphrase recovery documents in my Google Drive".

If you want to use the Google Drive as a digital "safe place," it's recommended that you only use it for 2-of-3 splitting, not for 2-of-2.  If the person whom you trust changes their email addresses, or doesn't see the notification email, etc., the recovery phrases kept on Google Drive are effectively lost.

## <a name="write-instructions"></a>Fill Out Recovery Sheets

We can't just write our recovery phrases on paper.  We need to provide clear instructions in order for our password to actually be recovered.  Recovery sheets are available:

**<a target="_blank" href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/Recovery-Sheet.pdf">Blank PDF Recovery Sheet</a>**

**<a target="_blank" href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/Recovery-Sheet.txt">Text Recovery Sheet</a>**

Print out one sheet per passphrase and fill it out **by hand**.  An example filled sheet is below:

*Note that recovery sheets should NOT indicate where any other recovery phrase sheets are, or who has them.  That knowledge is entrusted with the individuals you’ve selected.*

<a target="_blank" href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/Recovery-Sheet.pdf"><img class="width-100 center-block" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/img/20190118-filled-recovery-sheet.png"/></a>

## <a name="test-instructions"></a>Test Your Instructions

Double check that you've indicated the correct wordlist to use for recovery on all recovery sheets, and that each pair of recovery passphrases works as intended to recreate your secret passphrase.

Make sure everything needed to actually access the account is provided on the recovery sheet:

* Is two-factor authentication enabled on the account?  If so, you'll want to include all relevant information so the account can be accessed, including perhaps the phone number if text messaging two-factor authentication is used, or if a "Google Authenticator"-style one-time codes are used, you could [make a backup of the code](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/2018/How-to-Store-2nd-Factor-TOTP-QR-Codes.html) and staple it to the recovery sheet.
* If the password is for KeePass or some other password-protected computer file, note where the file can be found.  Perhaps the you'll want to leave the file on a USB drive or in a certain location on your computer's hard drive.

## <a name="distribute"></a>Distribute the Recovery Phrase Sheets

If you're using Google Drive with Google's Inactive Account Manager, you should have filled out two text file versions of the recovery sheet.  Otherwise, at this point you should have your recovery sheets printed and filled out by hand: two sheets for 2-of-2 splitting, or six sheets for 2-of-3 splitting.

You can now provide your paper recovery sheets to your safe people/places.

## <a name="maintenance"></a>Annual Maintenance

Create a calendar reminder.  Every year, you’ll want to check a few things.

* Is your 15 year old 6-word Diceware passphrase now considered too short to be safe?
* Has your master passphrase changed?  If so, you need to recreate new recovery passphrases and distribute them.
* Do all your designated people/places still have access to your recovery passphrase as intended?
* Was there a chance an unauthorized person saw one of more of your recovery phrase sheets during the year?  If this is a possibility, you’d want to change your passphrase and distribute new recovery sheets.

## <a name="non-diceware"></a>Non-Diceware Password Splitting

Diceware allows us to pick strong purely random recovery phrases by rolling dice.  It's also possible to use dice  with other wordlists (and character lists) to create recovery phrases.  The easiest way to do this is to use the custom-numbered wordlists below:

* [95-character numbered ASCII character list](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/ASCII-philthompson.me.txt) uses three 6-sided dice
* [2048-word BIP-39 English Wordlist](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/BIP-0039-english-dice.txt) uses five 6-sided dice

For example, we can split a 12-character regular password with a [95-character numbered ASCII character list](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/ASCII-philthompson.me.txt).

If our secret password `S` is

	Password S
	qL/n9+J')g:B

The number value for each character can be found in the [95-character numbered ASCII character list](${SITE_ROOT_REL}/paper-password-splitting/ASCII-philthompson.me.txt) as

	43   64   93   40   9   26   62   87   20   33   86   54

By rolling three 6-sided die, one roll per character in the passphrase, we can come up with recovery phrase `A1`

	roll 423 → - (23)
	roll 112 → 2 (2)
	roll 341 → < (91)
	roll 412 → % (15)
	...

	23   2   91   15   64   51   36   43   53   35   17   64

	Recovery Password A1
	-2<%LyjqAi&L

Then by subtracting `A1` from `S` we find recovery password `A2`:

	(S - A1) mod 95

	q (43) - - (23)
	43 - 23 → ) (20)

	L (64) - 2 (2)
	64 - 2 → J (62)

	/ (93) - < (91)
	93 - 91 → 2 (2)

	n (40) - % (15)
	40 - 15 → = (25)

	9 (9) - L (64)
	9 - 64 → -55 → -55 + 95 → n (40)
	(since -55 is less than 1, we add 95 to get a number from 1-95)

	...

	Recovery Password A2
	)J2=nR+rJ/Q;
