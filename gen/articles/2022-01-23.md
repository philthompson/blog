<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/img/20220123.jpg"/></a> Today's JavaScript minification and linting is popularly done with node.js packages.  I want to run a couple of these packages on some JavaScript files, but I don't want to install npm on my machine.

Docker is perfectly suited for this task.

This article assumes some knowledge of Docker, and that you have it installed already.  I'm running Docker here on a linux machine, where I have access to bash shell scripting as well.

Create a folder somewhere.  I'm calling this image `min-lint`.  Here's a look at what this folder will contain:

	$ ls -1 min-lint-docker/
	Dockerfile
	js-input-files/
	js-output-files/
	run-min-lint.sh
	run.sh

For linting I am installing `jshint`, and for minifying, `terser`.  Let's start with the script that will actually run them.  The script will need two arguments, the input and output folders.  Here's `run-min-lint.sh`:

	#!/bin/bash
	#
	# run jshint on the entire input dir (arg 1)
	#   (results written to stdout)
	#
	# run terser to minify each .js file individually
	#   found in input directory (arg 1)
	#
	# output to a file of the same name in the given
	#   output directory (arg 2)
	#

	jshint --config "${1}"/jshint-config.json "${1}"

	find "${1}" -type f -name "*.js" | while read JS_FILE
	do
	  terser "${JS_FILE}" --output "${2}/`basename ${JS_FILE}`"
	done

Next, define a small Docker image that installs the npm executables, and runs the above script.  Here's the `Dockerfile`:

	# use the small alpine-based node.js image
	FROM node:17-alpine

	# I like to use bash scripts, so install that
	RUN apk add --no-cache bash

	# install with -g flag so the terser and jshint executables can be used by the shell
	RUN npm install terser -g
	RUN npm install jshint -g

	# trailing slash is important, to copy file into the dir
	COPY run-min-lint.sh /opt/

	# these dirs are bind mounted from the host when this
	#   container image is run
	ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/run-min-lint.sh", "/js-input-files/", "/js-output-files/"]


To run the image, we need to run a few commands, so I'm using a bash script.  Docker’s "bind mounted" volumes allow us to access a pair of directories both on the host and within the container.  Here's the `run.sh`:

	#!/bin/bash

	# ensure we can run this script from anywhere on the host
	THIS_SCRIPT="`readlink -f "${0}"`"
	THIS_DIR="`dirname "${THIS_SCRIPT}"`"
	cd "${THIS_DIR}"

	mkdir -p js-input-files
	mkdir -p js-output-files

	# remove any previous dangling images, if any
	OLD_IMAGES="$(docker images --filter "label=me.philthompson.image=min-lint" --filter "dangling=true" -q --no-trunc)"
	if [ ! -z "${OLD_IMAGES}" ]
	then
	  docker image rm $OLD_IMAGES
	fi

	# build a docker image using the Dockerfile in this directory
	docker build --label me.philthompson.image=min-lint -t min-lint .

	# run the image (NOT in -d detached mode)
	# for -v, the host side of the "host:container" syntax
	#   must be either an absolute path, or a volume name
	# make sure to include "--rm" so Docker cleans up afterwards
	docker run \
	  --rm \
	  -v ${THIS_DIR}/js-output-files:/js-output-files \
	  -v ${THIS_DIR}/js-input-files:/js-input-files \
	  min-lint


That's about it!  Put the JavaScript files (and `jshint-config.json` file) into the `js-input-files/` directory, run the image with `run.sh`, and voilà.  The minified files are written to the `js-output-files/` directory.  Linting messages are visible in the `stdout` stream of `run.sh`.
