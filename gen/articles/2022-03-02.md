<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/img/20220302.jpg"/></a> Yesterday I completed my 50th <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> puzzle.  Since I had successfully completed all 50 Wordles I'd ever attempted, I figured it was a good stopping point.  So long, Wordle.  It's been a treat.
