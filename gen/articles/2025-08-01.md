Once again, it's time for the annual NFL Elo update!  I've completed my biggest model search yet,
resulting in a more historically accurate model.  Last year's model search used historic games going
back to 2010, but this year's goes back to 1992.  See "The Search" below for more details.

The new <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2025.html">2025 season ratings and rankings page</a> is now live!
Previous season pages, starting with <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2024.html">2024</a>, have been
updated to show ratings and rankings calculated with the new model.

The season pages using last year's model are now available as a new set of "frozen" pages
that show the ratings and rankings as they appeared immediately following the Super Bowl
in February 2025:

<ul>
<li>Regular model "frozen February 2025" pages: <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2024-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2024</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2023-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2023</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2022-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2022</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2021-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2021</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2020-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2020</a></li>
<li>"Blank Slate" model "frozen February 2025" pages: <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2024-only-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2024</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2023-only-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2023</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2022-only-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2022</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2021-only-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2021</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2020-only-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2020</a></li>
<li>"Never Lose Elo For a Win" model "frozen February 2025" pages: <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2024-winpos-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2024</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2023-winpos-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2023</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2022-winpos-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2022</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2021-winpos-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2021</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2020-winpos-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2020</a></li>
<li>"No Margin of Victory" model "frozen February 2025" pages: <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2024-nomov-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2024</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2023-nomov-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2023</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2022-nomov-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2022</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2021-nomov-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2021</a>, <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/nfl-elo/2020-nomov-frozen-Feb-2025.html">2020</a></li>
</ul>

For the 2025 season, I am ending the experiments with the "Never Lose Elo For a Win" and "No Margin of Victory" models.
While interesting to look at, they are less accurate than the "regular" model and just create a lot of
complication for me and likely cause confusion for readers.  I'll continue to evaluate experimental model changes,
and as always will publish ratings and rankings using whatever model is most accurate.


## Elo model Background

For background on why and how I apply Elo ratings to NFL teams, see <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/2024/NFL-Elo-Power-Rankings-for-2024.html#elo-model-background">last year's post</a>.

## Comparing Models

Like last year, Elo models were compared using a "score" value, where higher scores are better:

<math display="block" style="font-size:1.4rem">
  <mrow>
    <mtext>score</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>winners</mtext><mo>-</mo><mo>(</mo><mtext>stddev</mtext><mo>*</mo><mn>5.5</mn><mo>)</mo>
  </mrow>
</math>

where:

* "winners" &mdash; the number of correctly-picked game winners
* "stddev" &mdash; the standard deviation of the percentage of correctly-picked game winners across seasons
  * the idea is to decrease the score of models that have more variation from one season to the next, so as to penalize overfitting

The 5.5 value is subjective, but appeared to create a nice balance between accuracy and consistency
from one season to the next.

I calculated the scores with weighting to place more weight on more recent seasons.  Due to rule changes
over the years, there are likely differences between how, for example, a 14-point margin of victory on the road "should"
be rewarded for the 2024 season vs. the 1994 season.  Since whatever difference that might be from season to season is
unknowable, I gradually decreased the weight of historic seasons.  The score in the table below reflects weighted winners
and weighted "stddev" from 1992-2024, where 1992 and 1993 were "warmup" (uncounted) seasons and where 2004-2024 are fully
weighted.  Before 2004, seasons decrease in weight linearly until 1995 and earlier, which have a 10% weight.

## The Search

For each model "type" in the table below, I ran a search of 10 million random models.  I experimented with
<a target="_blank" href="https://optuna.org/">Optuna</a> to find models using
an algorithmic approach, but I found it never was able to match the accuracy of the best models found
with pure brute force: completely random models.  I did end up using Optuna to replace my custom
"fine tune" procedure performed on the random models.  In the end, I found using models generated with
random parameters, then "fine-tuned" with Optuna, gave the best results.

To further refine the best found random models, I took a handful of the best random models and
performed a "merge" for each pair among them.  When "merging" a pair of models, every possible combination
of their parameters was tested (after being "fine tuned" with Optuna) as a child "generation 2" model.
Child models were only kept if they were better than both parents, and this was repeated for each generation.
The single best "Never Lose Elo For a Win" model ended up being a generation 6 model, and the best
"regular" model was generation 5.  I did a similar "genetic refinement" process in last offseason's model
search, but the child models weren't fully "fine tuned" like this year.

In my first <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/2024/NFL-Elo-Power-Rankings-for-2024.html#embracing-randomness">automated
model search from last year</a>, I examined random models over 12 fully-weighted seasons from 2012-2023.  I'm
not sure how many models were examined, but I believe it was somewhere between a few hundred thousand and a million.
To reduce the chance of finding an outlier overfitted model (that could perform poorly in the upcoming season)
I increased the number of evaluated seasons from 12 to 21, plus an additional 10 seasons at a reduced weight.

After examining 10 million models for each of the two model "types" below, the one listed in the top row of
the table below, as expected, turned out to have the best accuracy.  That model, which I'll call `v3.2025.06`
is being used for the 2025 season.

## Model "Types"

As of August 2025, I haven't completed the model search for all model types.  I plan to try to at least complete
the search for a better "blank slate" model before the 2025 season begins.  Running the randomized search for each
model type took my computer several weeks, and then the merge process took another few days longer.  This
search turned my computer into a little space heater!  I'm looking forward to running it once my office is chilly
again in the fall.

The columns show features that are switched on and off for the different model types:

* "division adj" &mdash; apply a factor to penalize strong teams less for "worse than expected" performance against division opponents (and vice versa)
* "seed lock adj" &mdash; apply a factor to penalize teams less for losing "meaningless" games at the end of the season
* "winpos" &mdash; never lose Elo rating points for a win: teams lose no Elo rating points after beating a weaker team by a smaller than expected margin
* "no MOV" &mdash; margin of victory is not involved in Elo rating points exchange
* "blank slate" &mdash; all teams begin every season with the same Elo rating

## Plots by Season and by Week of Season

When looking by season, we see the newer `v3.2025.06` model is consistently more accurate than the `v2.2024.07` model
in seasons from 1995-2011, which is expected because last year's model wasn't evaluated against those seasons.  There is
less of a consistent pattern in more recent seasons, and the newer model just happens to have been much more accurate
for the 2024 season.  Again, the 2024 season wasn't weighted more heavily than any other season from 2004 onwards.

<p class="wrap-wider-child">
	<a target="_blank" href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/s/img/2025/20250801-Pick_Pct_By_Season_v2.2024.07_vs_v3.2025.06_1994-2024.png">
		<img class="width-100 center-block" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/s/img/2025/20250801-Pick_Pct_By_Season_v2.2024.07_vs_v3.2025.06_1994-2024.png"/>
	</a>
</p>

By week of season, we see the newer `v3.2025.06` model is consistently better, and especially by the end of the season
and into the playoffs, which seems to be a good sign.  The newer model is significantly better in weeks 20, 21, and 22,
which, depending on the season, were conference championship or Super Bowl weeks.  It's worth noting here that all weeks
are treated the same when evaluating models, so for example playoff games are not weighted more heavily than regular season
games.  It's also interesting that week 10 continues to be an unpredictable week even for the newest model.

## 2025 Model and Season Page Improvements

Aside from the offseason model updates, there have been no changes or features added to the NFL Elo rating pages themselves.

I'll update this section if any changes are made during the season, either to the pages to the models.
