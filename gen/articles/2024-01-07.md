<a href="${THIS_ARTICLE}"><img style="float: left" class="width-resp-50-100" src="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/s/img/2023/2023-03-22-191828-00-R6PT7808-2-sm.jpg"/></a> New photo gallery pages are now available!

It's that time of year for photographers... dealing with the mountain of images created during the year.  Along those lines, this seemed like a good time to work on a way to showcase my non-birding photos, and to finally make it a bit easier to navigate among the galleries published here.

Firstly, I've gone through my 2021-2023 archive and put my favorite non-bird photos into yearly galleries.  <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/photos/2023.html">Here's the 2023 gallery</a>.

And for navigation I've created a new <a href="${SITE_ROOT_REL}/photo-galleries.html">Photo Galleries Page</a> with links to all galleries.
