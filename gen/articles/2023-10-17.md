Yesterday, I published an update to my NFL Elo rating model, and today I published the "after week 6" ratings and rankings.

In this post, I'd like to compare the accuracy stats for three different models.

### The Models

* **Bigger K**
  * This is the newest model, featuring a bigger "K-factor" (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details">see Wikipedia</a>) to be more responsive to individual games.
* **Original**
  * This is the latest version of the initial model, featuring a smaller "K-factor"
* **Blank Slate**
  * This model completely resets all teams to a 1500 rating ahead of week 1

### The Error Rates

#### Number of Game Winners Picked

For games since week 1 of the 2013 season, below we see the number of game winners correctly picked by each model.  To compare early-season vs late-season, this data is broken down by week.  The first row, for example, shows the number of game winners correctly picked on all weeks (on and after week 1).  The 8th row only counts games on and after week 8, about mid-way through the season.

<table>
<tr><th colspan="5">Number of Game Winners Picked by Model</th></tr>
<tr><th>Games Count</th><th>Game Weeks</th><th>Bigger K</th><th>Original</th><th>Blank Slate</th></tr>
<tr><td>2800</td><td>on+after wk. 1</td><td>1832</td><td>1832</td><td>1724</td></tr>
<tr><td>2625</td><td>on+after wk. 2</td><td>1722</td><td>1718</td><td>1638</td></tr>

<tr><td>1643</td><td>on+after wk. 8</td><td>1091</td><td>1090</td><td>1064</td></tr>
<tr><td>1502</td><td>on+after wk. 9</td><td>988</td><td>983</td><td>974</td></tr>
<tr><td>1369</td><td>on+after wk. 10</td><td>909</td><td>904</td><td>896</td></tr>
<tr><td>1231</td><td>on+after wk. 11</td><td>830</td><td>827</td><td>817</td></tr>
<tr><td>1090</td><td>on+after wk. 12</td><td>728</td><td>728</td><td>719</td></tr>
<tr><td>937</td><td>on+after wk. 13</td><td>622</td><td>626</td><td>609</td></tr>
<tr><td>782</td><td>on+after wk. 14</td><td>520</td><td>524</td><td>513</td></tr>
<tr><td>627</td><td>on+after wk. 15</td><td>420</td><td>421</td><td>415</td></tr>
<tr><td>467</td><td>on+after wk. 16</td><td>311</td><td>313</td><td>308</td></tr>
</table>

We can see that the "Bigger K" model picks the same number of game winners as the "Original" model, and generally does a better job toward the beginning and middle of the season while the "Original" model does a better job picking winners in the last few weeks of the season.

The "Blank Slate" model picks far fewer game winners correctly in the beginning of the season, but by the end of the season, as expected, performs similarly to the other models (though still a bit worse).

#### Elo Score Differential

The "Elo score differential" table below shows how accurate the expected margin of victory is.  It shows the median value over all tested games, again since week 1 of the 2013 season.

The "Elo score" applies to a single football game, and is adjusted to fit a 0.0 to 1.0 scale.  A team that gets "blown out" earns a 0.0, teams that tie earn a 0.5, and a team that wins in a blowout earns a score of 1.0.  The model calculates an estimated score between 0.0 and 1.0 for each team (the sum of both teams' scores is 1.0) and then it calculates the difference between the actual margin of victory and the estimated one.

A median "Elo score differential" of 0.1179 means that just as many games had an actual Elo score less than 0.1179 away from the estimated score.  In other words, the estimated margins of victory/defeat were less than 3.4 points off from the actual margins of victory/defeat just as often as they were more than 3.4 off from the actual margin.  (If I think of a better way to word this I'll edit this post.)

The "Original" model is better at predicting margins of victory/defeat than the "Bigger K" model.  The "Blank Slate" model is surprisingly good at predicting these margins, but for over some portions of the season (like on and after week 3, or on and after week 7), the "Original" model is still the best.

### Conclusions

The "Blank Slate" model is fun to look at, but is clearly less accurate.  It picks 108 fewer game winners than the other models since 2013.

The "Original" model is more conservative.  It effectively gives historically "good" teams the benefit of the doubt, and doesn't drop their Elo rating too much after a few bad games.  As a result, it is slightly more accurate in the later stages of the season than the "Bigger K" model.  Its conservative nature also increases its accuracy when it comes to estimating margins of victory.

The "Bigger K" model however reacts more strongly to individual games, and passes the "eye test" much more convincingly than the "Original" model, especially in the early stages of a season.  Accordingly, it does pick more winners in the beginning and middle of the season than the "Original" model.

Ideally, I'll be able to find a new model that gives us the best of both worlds.  For now however, I'm fine with publishing ratings and rankings produced by this new "Bigger K" model.
